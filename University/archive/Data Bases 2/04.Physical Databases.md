We want to manage data that is so big that cannot reside in the computer memory. Need a manager to retrieve data from the secondary memory.
# DATA ACCESS and COST MODEL
We want to manage the cost as we want to assign at each operation a cost and choose the operation that resolve a problem with the smallest cost.
Main memory: RAM, sometimes also called buffer. Typically organized in pages of the same size
Secondary memory: disk that is organized in blocks of the same size
Pages and Blocks need to be written/load in secondary/main memory to be stored/worked on.
Every time we write something in the secondary memory we are doing an IO operation and is the only cost that we are considering as it cost two order of magnitude more that any operation in main memory. We count the number of blocks that we read/write
### Main vs. Secondary memory access time
Secondary memory access:
- seek time (8-12ms) - head positioning on the correct track
- latency time (2-8ms) - disc rotation on the correct sector
- transfer time (~1ms) - data transfer
The cost of an access to secondary memory is 4 orders of magnitude higher than that to main memory
In "I/O bound" applications the cost exclusively depends on the number of accesses to secondary memory
Cost of a query = #blocks to be moved to execute a query
### DBMS and file system
File System (FS): component of the OS which manages access to secondary memory 
DBMSs make limited use of FS functionalities (create/delete files, read/write blocks)
The DBMS directly manages the file organization, both in terms of the distribution of records within
blocks and with respect to the internal structure of each block
A DBMS may also control the physical allocation of blocks onto the disk (for faster sequential reads, fine grain control of write operation execution time, reliability, etc.)
# PHYSICAL ACCESS STRUCTURES
Each DBMS has a distinctive and limited set of access methods
Access methods: software modules that provide data access and manipulation (store and retrieve) primitives for each physical data structure
Access methods have their own data structures to organize data
Each table is stored into exactly one primary physical data structure, and may have one or many optional secondary access structures(only pointer to data, convenient way to know where data is)

Primary structure: it contains all the **tuples** of a table:
- Main purpose: to store the table content
Secondary structures: are used to **index** primary structures, and only contain the values of some fields, interleaved with pointers to the blocks of the primary structure
- Main purpose: to speed up the search for specific tuples, according to some search criterion
Three main types of data access structures:
- Sequential structures
- Hash-based structures
- Tree-based structures
### Physical access structures
• Not all types of structures are equally suited for implementing the primary storage or a secondary access method

| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Sequential structures | Typical                                                                             | Not Used  |
| Hash-based structures | In some DBMSs (e.g., Oracle<br>hash clusters, IDM DB2<br>“organize by hash” tables) | Frequent  |
| Tree-based structures | Obsolete/rare                                                                       | Typical   |
#### Blocks and tuples
- Blocks: the "physical" components of files
- Tuples: the "logical" components of tables
The size of a block is typically fixed and depends on the file system and on how the disk is formatted
The size of a tuple (also called record) depends on the database design and is typically variable within a file(optional (possibly null) values, varchar (or other types of non-fixed size) attributes), it cannot be anticipated, we can only do average consideration if the size is not fixed beforehand.
#### Organization of tuples in blocks

Block header and trailer with control information used by the file system
Page header and trailer with control information about the access method
A page dictionary, which contains pointers (offset table) to each elementary item of useful data contained in the page
A useful part, which contains the data
- In general, page dictionaries and useful data grow as stacks in opposite directions
A checksum, to detect corrupted data(number used for checking that the data is correct)
#### How many tuples in a block: Block Factor
Block factor B: the number of tuples of the same type within a block
Fundamental for estimating cost of queries
- SR: Average size of a record/tuple (assuming "fixed length record")
- SB: Size of a block
	- if SB > SR, there may be many tuples in each block:$B = \lfloor SB / SR\rfloor \text{ ( \lfloor x \rfloor= floor(x) )}$
• The rest of the space can be:
- Used: tuples spanned between blocks (hung-up tuples/ records). Store just a part of a tuple and divide it in multiple blocks. Needed if tuples are larger than block size.
- Not used: unspanned records
### Buffer manager primitives
Operations are performed in main memory and affect pages
In our cost model we assume pages of equal size and organization as blocks
Operations are:
- Insertion and update of a tuple
	- may require a reorganization of the page or usage of a new page
	- also update to a field may require reorganization (e.g., varchar)
- Deletion of a tuple
	- often carried out by marking the tuple as ‘invalid’ and triggering later reorganization of page asynchronously
- Access to a field of a particular tuple
	- identified according to an offset w.r.t. the beginning of the tuple and the length of the field itself (stored in the page dictionary)
### Sequential structures
Sequential arrangement of tuples in the secondary memory (access to next element is supported)
Blocks can be contiguous on disk or sparse 
Two cases:
- Entry-sequenced organization: sequence of tuples dictated by their order of entry(append them in the order they arrive)
- Sequentially-ordered organization: tuples ordered according to the value of a key (one or more attributes). 
#### Entry-sequenced sequential (a.k.a. heap) structure
Effective for:
- Insertion, which does not require shifting
- Space occupancy, as it uses all the blocks available for files and all the space within the blocks
- Sequential reading and writing (select * from T)
	- Especially if the disk blocks are contiguous (seek & latency times reduced)
	- Only if all (or most of) the file is to be accessed
Non-optimal for
- Searching specific data units (select * from T where…)
	- May require scanning the whole structure
	- But can be used efficiently with indexes
- Updates that increase the size of a tuple (“shifts” required)
	- Shift may require storage in another block
	- Alternative approach: delete old version and insert new one
#### Sequentially-ordered sequential structure
Tuples are sorted based on the value of a key field
Effective for:
- Range queries that retrieve tuples having key in an interval
- Order by and group by queries exploiting the key
Problem: insertions & updates that increase the size
- Reordering of the tuples within the block, if space allows
- Techniques to avoid global reordering:
	- Differential files + periodic merging
	- Free space in the block at loading $\rightarrow$ ‘local reordering’ operations
	- Overflow file: new tuples are inserted into blocks linked to form an overflow chain (general principle used also in other organizations)
