The Concurrency Control System manages the simultaneous execution of transactions,avoids the insurgence of anomalies while ensuring performance.
One of the advantages of concurrency is to exploit the parallelism to maximise transactions per second(TPS).
The problems of concurrency is that the transactions have to be executed in parallel as they were done in sequence.
Concurrency is fundamental as DB need to execute tens or hundreds of transactions per second and naturally they cannot be done serially, but the concurrent execution may cause anomalies $\rightarrow$ concurrency needs to be controlled

### Execution with Lost Update
An update is applied from a state that ignores a preceding update, which is lost
D = 100
1 $T_1$: r(D $\rightarrow$ x)
2 $T_1$: x = x + 3
3     _$T_2$: r(D $\rightarrow$ y)_
4     _$T_2$: y = y + 6_
5 $T_1$: w(x $\rightarrow$ D) D = 103 
6     _$T_2$: w(y $\rightarrow$ D) D = 106 !_
Note: this anomaly does not depend merely on $T_2$ overwriting the value produced by $T_1$
- $w_1$(D), $w_2$(D) is ok (serial)
- $r_1$(D), $w_1$(D), $w_2$(D) is ok too (serial)
-  $r_1$(D), $r_2$(D), $w_1$(D), $w_2$(D) is not ok: inconsistent updates from the same 
### Dirty Read
An uncommitted value is used to update the data
D = 100
1 $T_1$: r(D $\rightarrow$ x)
2 $T_1$: x = x + 3
3 $T_1$: w(x $\rightarrow$ D) D = 103 
4 $T_2$: r(D $\rightarrow$ y) this read is “dirty” (uncommitted value) 
5 $T_1$: rollback
6 $T_2$: y = y + 6
7 $T_2$: w(y $\rightarrow$ D) D = 109 !
### Non-Repeatable Read
Someone else updates a previously read value
D = 100
1 $T_1$: r(D  $\rightarrow$ x)
2 $T_2$: r(D  $\rightarrow$ y)
3 $T_2$: y = y + 6
4 $T_2$: w(y  $\rightarrow$ D) D = 106
5 $T_1$: r(D  $\rightarrow$ z) z <> x !
###  Phantom update
Someone else updates data that contributes to a previously valid constraint
Constraint: A+B+C=100, A=50, B=30, C=20
$T_1$: r(A $\rightarrow$ x), r(B $\rightarrow$ y)……
$T_2$: r(B $\rightarrow$ s), r(C $\rightarrow$ t)
$T_2$: s = s + 10, t = t – 10 
$T_2$: w(s $\rightarrow$ B), w(t $\rightarrow$ C) (now B=40, C=10, A+B+C=100) 
$T_1$: r(C $\rightarrow$ z) (but, for $T_1$, x+y+z = A+B+C = 90!)
So for $T_1$ it is as if “somebody else” had updated the value of the sum
But for $T_2$ the update is perfectly legal (does not change the value of the sum)
### Phantom Insert
Someone else inserts data that contributes to a previously read datum
$T_1$: C=AVG(B: A=1) 
$T_2$: Insert (A=1,B=2
$T_1$: C=AVG(B: A=1) 
Note: this anomaly does not depend on data already present in the DB when $T_1$ executes, but on a “phantom” tuple that is inserted by “someone else” and satisfies the conditions of a previous query of $T_1$
# Concurrency Theory vs System Implementation
Model: an abstraction of a system, object or process, which purposely disregards details to simplify the investigation of relevant properties
Concurrency Theory builds upon a model of transactions and concurrency control principles that helps understanding real systems
Real systems exploit implementation level mechanisms  (locks, snapshots) which help achieve some of the desirable properties postulated by the theory:
- Do not look for a view or conflict serializability checker in your DBMS
- Look instead for lock tables, lock types, lock granting rules, snapshots, etc..
- Understand how the implementation mechanisms ensure properties modelled by the Concurrency Theory
# Transactions, Operations, Schedules
Operation: a read or write of a specific datum by a specific transaction
Schedule: a sequence of operations performed by concurrent transactions __that respects the order of operations of each transaction__
# Schedules
