The goal of the course is to learn the basics of networked software using selected technology as example. We will learn by doing. 
Approach:
- Video lectures posted on the google calendar. Use also Webeep for communications. These create a foundation to come to class and can resolve the exercises. Come to class prepared.
- Lab work is thought to exercise the understanding of the concept explained in the video lectures
	- Evaluation labs: same as Lab work BUT you will have to submit a work at the end of the lab and each consist of 6 points of the final mark
	- Project work: based on specifications and can be submitted after the semester ends. The project will be discussed and evaluated.
If there is an installation issue ask on Webeep forum BEFORE the lab.
In Lab work there will be programming tasks and two or three hours to solve them. After the lecture solutions will be published. If the solution founded is different from the published one ask on Webeep to discuss why and if it is a correct solution. 
Evaluation labs you have three hours to solve the programming exercise and then submit the solutions on Webeep. There could be random pick for specific questions on them after the lecture. They cannot be rescheduled. The whole group must be present, in the other case all the group fails the lab. You cannot leave the room before submitting the work. Need to be prepared with a redundant setup. You are responsible for what you submit. 
### Projects
Test what you have learned. Presented before the first evaluation lab. There will be two/three projects traces. Presented by appointment at any time after the end of the semester and before the end of the academic year. Must turn in code and documentation a few days before the presentation. Prepare a short presentation and be prepared on the project as a whole. 
Need to work on different machines, no working on single machines simulating different machines.
You can switch from Evaluation Labs to Project Work at any time, no the other way around. If you switch Update the registration form. You also loose all the points from the Evaluation labs obtained before.
