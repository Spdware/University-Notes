Wired connectivity is used where wireless connectivity cannot be applied for some reasons(example is in industrial settings).

In industrial scenarios is important to have certain constraint in the delay of a transmission, need to stay below some parameters. Using cables is better for reliability.
Having a wireless environment cuts costs as it cuts the cost for infrastructure deployment, maintenance, etc...
# Fieldbus
## Fieldbus Generalities
- Mainly targeting the interconnection of control devices and field devices (sensors/actuators)
- Short frequently-exchanged messages
- Tight requirements in terms of delay and determinism
Common scenarios are industrial scenarios(monitoring industrial plants, a controller that monitors machines, on smaller scenarios a vehicle that needs to be monitored).

The protocol doesn't have transport and network layers. Based on a 3-layer technology, without network or transport technologies. This because we are connecting all the sensors on a single bus, no need to routing(No network layer needed). Transmission layer is not needed as it will add another layer that would alter the determinism and add unnecessary complexity.
Data Link layer needs to sort out the communication without causing collisions.
### Short Digression on Channel Access
Problem
- To share a single communication medium (in our case a IEEE 802.15.4 frequency channel)
Solutions
- Scheduled access (“I Tell You when to Talk”, central entity decides when someone can talks, no conflicts are possible by design)
	- Transmissions on the channel are sequential with no conflicts
	- Polling schemes
	- Centralized scheduling schemes
- Random access (“You Decide when to Talk but be Wise in Recovering from Collisions”, two sensors can talk at the same time, needs to have recovery protocols)
	- Transmission are partially uncoordinated and can overlap(collision)
	- Conflicts are resolved using distributed procedures based on random retransmission delay(notice that there is a collision, stop transmitting and restart transmission at a random time)
## Scheduled vs Random Access
Scheduled Access (e.g., GSM, Bluetooth, Wifi PCF)
- PROs:
	“guaranteed” performance (bounded delay/throughput)
- CONs:
	 Coordination required (central node, synchronization, etc.)
	 Waste of resources as there can be someone that doesn't need the resource
Random Access (e.g., WiFi DCF, Ethernet)
- PROs:
	 Easy to implement
	 Opportunistic access to the resources
- CONs:
	 Only “Statistical” guarantees on performance, cannot guarantee performances as there can be heavy traffic
	 Poor performance under heavy traffic (collisions kick in), means very difficult to have an answer in time.
### Fieldbus Example: the CAN Bus
Connectivity based on shared physical bus
Everybody receives everything transmitted on the BUS

Similar to a broadcast communication architecture. 
Carrier Sensing Multiple Access(non scheduled)
Based on a 3-layer stacks.
 Carrier Sensing Multiple Access sense the BUS before transmitting; if BUS free
transmit otherwise refrain and try later(listen if there is already a transmission on the bus)

One problem with carrier sensing, especially when you have long cables: signals propagates at a finite speed so it takes some time for a signal to actually reach all the sensors in the network(vulnerability period, defined as the maximum distance between two sensors in the network, divide it by the speed of propagation). This can lead to cases where sensors think the carrier is free when in reality it is being used.
### BUS Arbitration
Each message has a priority (Lower identifier field means higher priority), 
Each station monitors its own transmission and the status of the BUS
If a transmitting station overhears another transmission on the channel at higher priority, then quits (e.g., B in the figure). It leaves space for the other transmission.

### Other Fieldbus technologies - PROFIBUS
![](https://i.imgur.com/pUU5l7Q.png)

Similar setup of CAN BUS, but the idea is it use polling as data link. There is a master station that polls the slaves(sensors) for transmission requests(collisions removed by designs)
# Ethernet

Born as a BUS technologies, there could be collisions. Next iterations changed using a hub/repeater plus twisted pairs were used, everything that was transmitted to the hub was propagated to all the stations connected to the hub. Nowadays we use switch ethernet to cut the transmission to only the receiver. 
## Ethernet Frame
![](https://i.imgur.com/aXW86De.png)

Ethernet uses both source and destination address.
### MAC Addresses
Uniquely identify any transmitter/receiver globally.
![](https://i.imgur.com/4YVIDn4.png)

First 3 bytes set the manufacturer
Last 3 bytes identify the interface
«All-ones» address used for broadcast: **FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF**, when used we replicate a bus as the transmission is received by all devices part of the transmission frame.

## CSMA/CD
Carrier Sensing Multiple Access 
	sense the BUS before transmitting; if BUS free transmit otherwise refrain and try later
Collision Detect
	If collision detected all the transmissions are aborted after a while
Using a switch you can resolve collision by design

![](https://i.imgur.com/TnN7mcR.png)

No collision as links are full duplex, there is a buffer and the switch read the destination address of the message and output it to the port related to the destination address.
## Ethernet @ Industry 4.0

Adds on to standard ethernet for giving real time performance/giving some timeliness to ethernet. The differentiation is the delay(MCT).

One option is the range of communication.  The other is the throughput, or how much data we can transfer in an unit of time.
