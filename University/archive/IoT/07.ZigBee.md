# Short Range Communication Technologies and Protocols
![](https://i.imgur.com/iPtNmmv.png)

Maximum range is hundred of meters, 100kbit of transmission, works in unlicensed bandwidth.
Highly fragmented technologies/standards/protocols
Fine for small-scale, hot spot coverage
The “Gateway Problem”(whenever the technology is not IP compliant the device need to pass through a gateway that translate the message to IP compliant way).
## Several Solutions available
Classification Guidelines
- Proprietary (WirelessHART) vs open standard (WiFi, ZigBee, 6LowPAN, THREAD)
- Application specific vs application agnostic
	ZWAVE for home automation, WirelessHART for industrial applications; 6LowPAN/THREAD for everything
- IP-compliant vs non-IP-compliant
## ZigBee vs 6LowPAN
 Main (rough) difference:
- 6LowPAN extends IP to the Internet of Things
- Zigbee doesn’t
Similarities in the lower layers

# ZigBee
Main features:
- Low-cost Hardware (2$) and software
- Limited TX range (~10m)
- Low Latency
- High Energy Efficiency!
Too many proprietary solutions in the field of IoT (mid 90s)
Dramatic compatibility/interoperability issues (and high costs)
WP 4 within IEEE launched in 2001 to have a reference technology
IEEE 802.15.4 standard published in March 2003.
The technology is often (misleadingly) referenced as: ZigBee
ZigBee uses IEEE 802.15.4 as lower layer and then builds on top of this.

## 802.15.4: Types of Devices
Full Function Device (FFD):
-  Can send beacons
- Can communicate with other FFDs
- Can route frames
- Can act as PAN coordinator
- Typically features power supply
Reduced Function Device (RFD):
- Cannot route frames
- Cannot communicate with other RFDs
- Can communicate with FFD
- Runs typically on batteries
PAN Coordinator
- Is responsible of a Personal Area Network (PAN)
- Manages PAN association/de-association
### Supported Topology: Stars
![](https://i.imgur.com/PDyNbgI.png)

All devices connected to the coordinator directly
### Supported topology: Mesh
![](https://i.imgur.com/6cdJSQY.png)

Forwarding messages between devices to reach the destination if there isn't a direct connection.
### Supported Topology: Cluster-Tree (not in 802.15.4 standard)

## 802.15.4: PHY
Activation and deactivation of the radio transceiver
Energy detection (ED) within the current channel
- Detect energy level for each channel (used to implement scanning functionalities)
Link quality indicator (LQI) for received packets
Clear channel assessment (CCA)
- Used to implement the carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA-CA)
Channel frequency selection
Data transmission and reception

3 channels available in 868MHz bands
30 channels available in the 915MHz bands
16 channels available in the 2.4GHz bands
### PHY: PDU format
![](https://i.imgur.com/6WjGZl0.png)

Preamble: to achieve synchronization
SFD: frame delimiter
Frame Length: length (in octets) of the PHY payload
- For MAC data frames in the range of [9-127]
## MAC Sublayer Tasks
The features of the MAC sublayer are:
- beacon management,
- channel access management,
- GTS management,
- Frame validation,
- acknowledged frame delivery,
- association, and disassociation,
- hooks for implementing application-appropriate security mechanisms
## MAC: Functional Description
Two operation modes are defined:
- Beacon Enabled
	- PAN coordinator periodically transmits beacons
	- Usually adopted in star topologies
	- Slotted CSMA/CA + scheduled transmissions
- Non Beacon Enabled
	- Uncoordinated access through unslotted CSMA/CA
In the beacon there is transmission scheduled in time division schedule.
### Beacon Enabled: functional description
![](https://i.imgur.com/GV8k2Nn.png)

Frame Length: from 15[ms] to 252[s] (15.38ms*2n where $0\le n \le 14)$
RFD associated to PAN coordinator are aligned with the frame structure
Random access through CSMA/CA in CAP
Guranteed Time Slot statically assigned by PAN coordinator through beacons
First part nodes can enter the carrier freely then there is a time where nodes can only access limited resources.
