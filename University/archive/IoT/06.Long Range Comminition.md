DIfference between Licensed and Unlicensed bandwidth/spectrum. Licensed spectrum is own by government/entity that owns that frequency in the area. The owner can offer the frequency to someone for a fee.
For Unlicensed spectrum everyone can use the frequency and so there will be a lot of interferences.
## LPWAN(Low Power Wide Area Network) Market Perspectives
Technologies that are efficients in terms of energy consumption and can span over a long range.

LoRaWAN is becoming the standard in the market. 
Mobile IoT, 5G world requires SIM cards to work.
### LPWAN: “cable replacement” or more?

## Cellular IoT Operators
Value proposition
- Lowest TCO
- Lowest Energy Consumption
- Out of the box connectivity
- Global Reach
These works in Unlicensed spectrum, usually in a part called sub-giga(more or less in 900MHz)
LoRa allow from 250Mbit/s to 20 kbit/s, we can have throughput of tens of kilobits per seconds.
These can span a really wide area, as we can see that smartphone connection can happen globally
## LoRaWAN Architecture
![](https://i.imgur.com/gUiWYiS.png)


- Association-less, cellular-like architecture
- End devices: field devices
- Gateways: receive and forward messages from end devices (and network server)
- Network server: where all the intelligence is
	 Remove duplicate messages, manages ACKs, manages radio link parameters, etc.
Splitted in two part: Physical part is done by LoRa
LoRa end nodes are the various sensors/devices that transmit data using LoRa technology(physical layer). Transmission protocol is similar to broadcast as there is not association between the sender and the receiver(LoRa concentrator).
Usually the end devices are connected to a Network server through one or more connection methodologies. The purpose of the concentrators is to forward the end nodes messages to the network servers, where the logic of the network reside. The servers removes the duplicates, and forward the messages to the actual application that needs the data.
### LoraWAN Protocol Stack
![](https://i.imgur.com/D62JHNs.png)

Three layers:
- Physical layer depending on LoRa, the frequency can change based on the country
- LoRa modulation: proprietary technology
- LoRa MAC(Medium Access Control): define 3 classes of devices
- Application layer
### LoRa$^{TM}$ Modulation
 Proprietary chirp-based spread spectrum(spread the energy of the signal over the time and make the reconstruction simpler even in case of interference)
 Signal is chipped at a higher data rate and modulated onto a chirp signal

 ![](https://i.imgur.com/rqHpTTk.png)

#### Chip and bit Rates
The chip rate [chip/s] and the nominal bit rate [bit/s] are related by the following
formulas
$$R_c = BW[chips/s]$$
 $$R_b = SF\frac{\frac{4}{4+CR}}{\frac{2^{SF}}{BW}} [b/s]$$
Where BW is the reference bandwidth and SF is the adopted spreading factor and CR is the coding rate
SF is how much I spread
**How to Choose?**
Two contrasting objectives:
- Rate: “I want to go fast” (low SF)
- Reliability: “I want to go safe” (high SF)
 For a given emitted power level
- Rate increases as SF decreases

![](https://i.imgur.com/xPaITUQ.png)

For a given emitted power level
- Better sensitivity (reliability increases) for higher SF
$$P_{min} = 174 + 10\log_{10} BW + N F + SNR$$
(SNR is inversely proportional to SF)

![](https://i.imgur.com/h6vxOGv.png)

Increasing the SF you can have a larger distance/robustness to interference for the same energy.
### LoraWAN End Devices
Class A:
- Downlink “slots” followingDL uplink transmissions, Downling slots are usually always on. Uplink direction is from an end device to a concentrator, downlink direction is when the server needs to talk with an end device
- ALOHA-like access in the uplink
- Most simple devices
Class B:
- “extra” downlink ”slots” available in a scheduled fashion
Class C:
- Almost continuous downlink “slots”
#### LoraWAN Class A Devices
![](https://i.imgur.com/YezWGhc.png)

In EU: RX_delay_1 = 1[s]; RX_delay_2= RX_delay_1 + 1[s]
If a preamble is detected during one of the receive windows, the radio receiver stays active until the downlink frame is demodulated
If a frame was detected and subsequently demodulated during the first receive window and the frame was intended for this end-device after address and MIC
(message integrity code) checks, the end-device does not open the second receive window
### LoraWAN Encapsulation
![](https://i.imgur.com/g2ue68U.png)

**PHY Message structure**
- Preamble
- Physical HeaDeR (PHDR)
- PHDR_CRC, CRC: fields used for integrity check
- PHYPayload: PHY message content
**MAC Message Header**
- Mtype: message type
- RFU: reserved for future use
- Major: tells the message format

![](https://i.imgur.com/jFdy0Ru.png)

Same confirmable/unconfirmable way of coap
### **MAC message payload**
![](https://i.imgur.com/0Z0twmM.png)

DevAddr: end device address
FCtrl: frame control field to manage adaptive data rate, ACK and
MAC commands
FCnt: frame counter to count up each transmitted frame
Fopts: frame options containing MAC commands
#### Frame Control Field
![](https://i.imgur.com/t6qP4Bp.png)

Up/Down way have different meanings.
ADR (adaptive data rate) and ADRACKReq are used to manage
adaptively the uplink/downlink data rate
ACK: is used as valid acknowledgement
Fpending is used to signal (in DL) the presence of additional
frame to be delivered to the device
FOptsLen indicates the size (in bytes) of the FOpts
Spreading factor controls the data rate so it can be changed on the fly.
In Downink knowing there are pending data means that other data are coming from the server.

![](https://i.imgur.com/YfKNM8o.png)

## ALOHA Protocol
No channel feedback required, only the ACK
Time is continuous
Protocol:
- The first packet in the transmission queue is transmitted as soon as ready
- If the ACK does not come, the transmission is re- attempted after a random number of slots X
Type of random access as it doesn't even perform carrier sensing. The rule is simple: when a device wants to transmit it tries to do so on the channel.
**ALOHA retransmissions**
![](https://i.imgur.com/V5LVznc.png)

Solve the collision by retransmitting both the packages that collide.
### ALOHA performances
![](https://i.imgur.com/uRjdzRB.png)

Assumptions:
- Stationarity: Sin=Sout
- Traffic G distributed according to Poisson process
	- Packet arrivals is a Poisson point process with parameter $\lambda$
	- Transmissions last T
	- G=T x $\lambda$
- S$_{in}$ incoming traffic
- S$_{out}$ outgoing traffic
- G traffic on the channel: transmissions + retransmissions
- S$_{out}$<=G

![](https://i.imgur.com/almoHEr.png)

The probability $P_s$ for a packet transmission to be successful is the probability that no other packet starts transmission in “conflict” period of 2T
$$P_s = P (N (t-T, t + T ) = 0) = e^{-2G}$$
The throughput is:
$$S = GP_s = Ge^{-2G}$$
# Mobile Radio Networks
They divide the areas in cells where there is a cellular base stations(rectangle antennas that give coverage to the cell). Base stations are connected to the core of the network through fiber cable. 
Cellular network where built to connect people's phone. A traditional network is built with few application in mind(voice, SMS, web browsing in the newer one), main driver is throughput. There are high-end terminal as they need to have high capabilities and resources, even thought they run on battery. Nowadays cellular covers is not present only on really isolated places(Sahara desert,...).
IoT wants to use the cellular networks but needs to adapt as it uses fragmented applications, many clients with low traffic and simple terminals(devices only acquire data usually they don't have output/input components other than sensors or they are really frugal).

![](https://i.imgur.com/dx6C2PQ.png)

# General NB-IoT Requirements
Smartphone exchange a lot of messages with the cells of a network the moment it enters the cell to let the communication go flawlessy. IoT engineer needs to simplify this design, at the cost of loosing something(parallel with TCP and UDP), to able the IoT devices to connect to cellular network. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/sOmVvCK.png)

The cellular network is already secure so we can use it, have devices with low power consumption, possibly non using IP packets(very rarely happens but is nice).
## CAT-M and NB-IoT Deployment Options
![](https://i.imgur.com/pa1r5ms.png)

4G/LTE works by dividing the carrirer in subcarriers of 128 kHz. When a smartphone receive/send data to the cellular station one of the subchannels reserve space on the station and then the base station handles the data on the stations needed to transmit the data.
Narrow Band uses really small channels. Depending on the deployment we can have different spaces.
Cat M uses a larger bandwidth so the overall throughput is larger that the one of a NB IoT application.
## Power Saving Mode
 It is a specially kind of UE status that can minimize the energy consumption that is supposed to be even lower than normal idle mode energy consumption
This is newly added feature in Release 12 and is specified in 3GPP 24.301-5.3.11 Power saving mode and 23.682-4.5.4 UE Power Saving Mode
Similar to power-off, but the UE remains registered with the network
No need to re-attach or re-establish PDN connections
A UE in PSM is not immediately reachable for mobile terminating services
It is a power saving mode where the device shut off its transmitter but remains registered in the network. This is nice as the connection takes a lot of messages to be acknowledged and so it is costly. This is also a more flexible operation.

![](https://i.imgur.com/HDTeNbZ.png)

Both NB IoT and Cat M devices can follow a duty cycle. Tricky part is to let the device know there is data to download from the network. We can do this through standardized timers(Delayed reception, allows to save a lot of battery). 
## NB-IoT Key Parameters
![](https://i.imgur.com/ihZaeBa.png)

### Random Access Procedure
As there are millions of devices that want to access the carrier we need to implement a signalling channel where devices transmit their preamble. When the base station decode the preamble it will reserve one of the subchannel for the device and tells to it to start transmitting data. As we can have collision there is preamble repetition to be sire that the base station receive the preamble.
#### Repetitions
![](https://i.imgur.com/eg6N8v7.png)

This also helps in receiving data from further stations and to have a more robust reception.
#### Coverage Levels
![](https://i.imgur.com/3Pt4mx9.png)

## Stripped LTE Features
![](https://i.imgur.com/4g2ThpV.png)

Handover let you move in a city and remains connected even if you switch cell. 
Intra-RAT is the switching between transmission technologies. 
No carrier integration where there is a throughput multiplication by loading multiple base station at the same station. Advanced feature supported only by high end terminals.
## COST SAVING: Lower-complexity UE Implementation
Significantly reduced transport block sizes for both downlink and uplink
Support only single-stream transmissions in both downlink and uplink
A UE only requires single antenna
Support only single HARQ* process in both downlink and uplink / support only one redundancy version in the downlink
No turbo decoder needed at the UE since only TBCC is used for downlink channels
No Connected Mode mobility measurements are required; the UE only needs to perform mobility measurement during the Idle mode
Low sampling rate possible due to lower UE bandwidth
Only half-duplex frequency-division duplexing (FDD) operation is used
No parallel-processing required; all the physical layer procedures and transmission and reception of physical channels occur in sequential manner
No MIMO technology, so no multiple streams for a single antenna.
