# What is an application?
An application is a piece of software in execution at a host and is able to communicate with another program through a network.
We exchange information to do something.
In general the application layer is a piece of software running between the two stacks to exchange and use data.
An example is a web browser such as Firefox or Google, another example is Email application(use SMTP as a protocol even if nowadays it can also check on HTTP).
In embedded applications there isn't a proper OS, much more lightweight, real time OS that gives access to the HW resources. 
## Need for Mediation
The internet stack in IoT doesn't hold anymore(lack of standardization, problems in applying the internet stack on top of devices with minimal OS and resources).
These problem is even worse in IIoT where each company can have its own protocol stack.
So the application layer takes an additional role of mediator for all the different stacks for the different protocol stack.
## Application Layer Protocols
Client/Server «web browsing approach»(State approach)
- HTTP
- COAP: lightweight HTTP
- OPC-UA: encountered in industrial settings
Publish/Subscribe «Twitter approach»
- MQTT
- OPC-UA
# Hyper Text Transfer Protocol(HTTP)
 Primer:
- Web pages composed of resources (HTML, images, applet, ...)
- each resource has a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). These allow the user to retrieve the resource and see it

## How Does the Web Work?
 Resources in the Web are:
- managed by servers
- identified by URIs
- accessed synchronously by clients through request/response paradigms
In a word, Representational State Transfer (REST)

If you misspell a resource you will get an error/will receive the fact that the resource doesn't exist.
### URL Resolution

In URL we have different information related to the different layers of the stack.
## HTTP Communication
client/server architecture:
- client: issues HTTP requests for specific resources (URIs)
- server: answers backs with the required resource
Transfer is stateless: no memory maintained at the server

The communication needs a TCP connection between the client and the server to even start.
### HTTP Request

### HTTP Responses

# COnstrained Application Protocol (COAP)
We use another protocol in IoT for several reasons:
- HTTP messages have a really big header(not liked in IoT systems for energy consumption)
- TCP is not a lightweight protocol, very cumbersome both in firmware and in complexity, big impact in both program memory and RAM
For these reasons COAP is created, it uses HTTP as a start and get rid of all the heavy stuffs.
 GOAL: to enable web-based services in constrained wireless networks
- 8 bit micro-controllers
- limited memory
- low-power networks
Problem: WEB solution are hardly applicable
- Solution: re-design web-based services for constrained networks -> COAP
## CoAP At a Glance
- Embedded web transfer protocol (coap://)
- Asynchronous transaction model(first difference, can issue a request on the server and receive the response later, helps to maintain the duty cycle)
- UDP binding with reliability and multicast support
- GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods
- URI support
- 4 byte header
- Subset of MIME types and HTTP response codes
- Built-in discovery
- Optional observation and block transfer
Need to implement reliability at the application layer. This is done in COAP.
The other big difference with HTTP is that the header is fixed at 4 bytes.
## The CoAP Architecture
![](https://i.imgur.com/YWfMBPU.png)

CoAP use CoAP clients and servers, could also have client to client communication. As CoAP is a REST transfer we have a CoAP HTTP translation(sometimes makes sense to have the hybrid way with a proxy that translate the messages.
### COAP Messaging Basics
Transport:
- (mainly) UDP binding
Message Exchange between Endpoints
- Messages with 4 bytes header (shared by request and responses) containing a message ID (16 bits)
- Reliable exchange through Confirmable Messages which must be acknowledged (through ACK or Reset Messages). Simple Stop-and-Wait retransmission with exponential back-off.
- Unreliable exchange through Non-Confirmable Message
- Duplicate detection for both confirmable and non-confirmable messages (through message ID)
Each message in CoAP can be Confirmable/Non Confirmable. If the message is confirmable the counterpart needs to confirm the message with an ACK, otherwise the ACK is not required but you can loose packages. We can use timers to retransmit messages with an exponential way to try to have a not congestionated connection.
### COAP Message Semantics
- REST Request/Response piggybacked on CoAP Messages
- Method, Response Code and Options (URI, content-type etc.)

Confirmable and Non Confirmable way.
### COAP Request/Response Examples

### COAP: Separate Response
![](https://i.imgur.com/6eapWSb.png)

During the passing of time both the server and client can go to sleep(usually only the server does it)
### COAP: Non-confirmable Request
![](https://i.imgur.com/U5urUFF.png)

## Message Header (4 bytes)
![](https://i.imgur.com/DI01dlZ.png)

**Ver** - Version (1)
**T** – Message Type (Confirmable, Non-Confirmable, Acknowledgement, Reset)
**TKL**- Token Length, if any, the number of Token bytes after this header
**Code** - Request Method (1-10) or Response Code (40-255)
**Message ID** – 16-bit identifier for matching responses
**Token** – Optional response matching token

Stop and Wait approach
Repeat a request after a time-out in case ACK (or RST) is not coming back
The timeout use an exponential backoff(duplicate at each failure)
### Back-Off Details
Initial time-out set to:
- Rand [ACK_TIMEOUT, ACK_TIMEOUT * ACK_RANDOM_FACTOR] ([2s, 3s])
When time-out expires and the transmission counter is less than MAX_RETRANSMIT (4)
- retransmit
- Increase transmission counter
- double the time-out value
The procedure is repeated until
- A ACK is received
- A RST message is received
- the transmission counter exceeds MAX_RETRANSMIT
- the total attempt duration exceeds MAX_TRANSMIT_WAIT (93s)
If there are more than 4 failures the process is aborted as there is some problem with the network. Also the dynamic is relaxed.
In IoT the client-server paradigm power is reversed as the servers are the one that receives information from the clients to gain information(push paradigms).
In CoAP the constraint sensors are on the server. In CoAP the limiting sensor nodes are the servers and the clients try to push things on.
## Proxyng and caching
![](https://i.imgur.com/Df1V75l.png)

We can cache the values of some measurements and the components can use the caching to response instead of asking to the other components. This is beneficial as we can avoid the communication with the CoAP server that is our bottleneck.
## COAP Observation
PROBLEM:
- REST paradigm is often “PULL” type, that is, data is obtained by issuing an explicit request 
- Information/data in WSN is often periodic/triggered (e.g., get me a temperature sample every 2 seconds or get me a warning if temperature goes below 5°C)
SOLUTION: use Observation on COAP resources
### Observation
![](https://i.imgur.com/PppdX82.png)

Server has the resources and is the limiting factor. In the option we set the Observe mode. The client is telling the server it wants to maintain registered on the updating of a resource. Doing so the server doesn't have to answer to multiple messages of the client but can simply send a message to the client each time the resource is updated. Use the same token with a different message ID.
This mode is beneficial when the dynamic of the resources is relaxed, if not the server still needs to send a lot of messages to the client.
## COAP Block Transfer
**PROBLEM**: avoid segmentation in the lower layers (IPv6), we doesn't want to fragment the messages has we have redundant information(header are replicated)
**SOLUTION**: COAP Block Transfer Mode 
- brings up fragmentation at the application layer, we create messages that remain in the maximum MTU(Message Transmission Unit)

 Block2 Option added to messages
- nr=incremental block number within original data
- m=more blocks flag
- sz=block size
## Discovery & Semantics
Resource Discovery
- GOAL: Discovering the links hosted by CoAP (or HTTP) servers
		GET /.well-known/core?optional_query_string
- Returns a link-header style format
	URL, relation, type, interface, content-type etc.
