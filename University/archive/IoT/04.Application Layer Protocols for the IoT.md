# What is an application?
An application is a piece of software in execution at a host and is able to communicate with another program through a network.
We exchange information to do something.
In general the application layer is a piece of software running between the two stacks to exchange and use data.
An example is a web browser such as Firefox or Google, another example is Email application(use SMTP as a protocol even if nowadays it can also check on HTTP).
In embedded applications there isn't a proper OS, much more lightweight, real time OS that gives access to the HW resources. 
## Need for Mediation
The internet stack in IoT doesn't hold anymore(lack of standardization, problems in applying the internet stack on top of devices with minimal OS and resources).
These problem is even worse in IIoT where each company can have its own protocol stack.
So the application layer takes an additional role of mediator for all the different stacks for the different protocol stack.
## Application Layer Protocols
Client/Server «web browsing approach»(State approach)
- HTTP
- COAP: lightweight HTTP
- OPC-UA: encountered in industrial settings
Publish/Subscribe «Twitter approach»
- MQTT
- OPC-UA
# Hyper Text Transfer Protocol(HTTP)
 Primer:
- Web pages composed of resources (HTML, images, applet, ...)
- each resource has a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). These allow the user to retrieve the resource and see it

![](https://i.imgur.com/wwwjiEO.png)

## How Does the Web Work?
 Resources in the Web are:
- managed by servers
- identified by URIs
- accessed synchronously by clients through request/response paradigms
In a word, Representational State Transfer (REST)

![](https://i.imgur.com/yDncae3.png)

If you misspell a resource you will get an error/will receive the fact that the resource doesn't exist.
### URL Resolution
![](https://i.imgur.com/9DVIOXO.png)

In URL we have different information related to the different layers of the stack.
## HTTP Communication
client/server architecture:
- client: issues HTTP requests for specific resources (URIs)
- server: answers backs with the required resource
Transfer is stateless: no memory maintained at the server

![](https://i.imgur.com/hXd8Pr4.png)

The communication needs a TCP connection between the client and the server to even start.
### HTTP Request

### HTTP Responses
![](https://i.imgur.com/wMiEaTW.png)

# COnstrained Application Protocol (COAP)
We use another protocol in IoT for several reasons:
- HTTP messages have a really big header(not liked in IoT systems for energy consumption)
- TCP is not a lightweight protocol, very cumbersome both in firmware and in complexity, big impact in both program memory and RAM
For these reasons COAP is created, it uses HTTP as a start and get rid of all the heavy stuffs.
 GOAL: to enable web-based services in constrained wireless networks
- 8 bit micro-controllers
- limited memory
- low-power networks
Problem: WEB solution are hardly applicable
- Solution: re-design web-based services for constrained networks -> COAP
## CoAP At a Glance
- Embedded web transfer protocol (coap://)
- Asynchronous transaction model(first difference, can issue a request on the server and receive the response later, helps to maintain the duty cycle)
- UDP binding with reliability and multicast support
- GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods
- URI support
- 4 byte header
- Subset of MIME types and HTTP response codes
- Built-in discovery
- Optional observation and block transfer
Need to implement reliability at the application layer. This is done in COAP.
The other big difference with HTTP is that the header is fixed at 4 bytes.
## The CoAP Architecture
![](https://i.imgur.com/YWfMBPU.png)

CoAP use CoAP clients and servers, could also have client to client communication. As CoAP is a REST transfer we have a CoAP HTTP translation(sometimes makes sense to have the hybrid way with a proxy that translate the messages.
### COAP Messaging Basics
Transport:
- (mainly) UDP binding
Message Exchange between Endpoints
- Messages with 4 bytes header (shared by request and responses) containing a message ID (16 bits)
- Reliable exchange through Confirmable Messages which must be acknowledged (through ACK or Reset Messages). Simple Stop-and-Wait retransmission with exponential back-off.
- Unreliable exchange through Non-Confirmable Message
- Duplicate detection for both confirmable and non-confirmable messages (through message ID)
Each message in CoAP can be Confirmable/Non Confirmable. If the message is confirmable the counterpart needs to confirm the message with an ACK, otherwise the ACK is not required but you can loose packages. We can use timers to retransmit messages with an exponential way to try to have a not congestionated connection.
### COAP Message Semantics
- REST Request/Response piggybacked on CoAP Messages
- Method, Response Code and Options (URI, content-type etc.)

### COAP Messaging
![](https://i.imgur.com/CIyEXBD.png)

Confirmable and Non Confirmable way.
### COAP Request/Response Examples
![](https://i.imgur.com/ZkJwyzi.png)

### COAP: Separate Response
![](https://i.imgur.com/6eapWSb.png)

During the passing of time both the server and client can go to sleep(usually only the server does it)
### COAP: Non-confirmable Request
![](https://i.imgur.com/U5urUFF.png)

## Message Header (4 bytes)
![](https://i.imgur.com/DI01dlZ.png)

**Ver** - Version (1)
**T** – Message Type (Confirmable, Non-Confirmable, Acknowledgement, Reset)
**TKL**- Token Length, if any, the number of Token bytes after this header
**Code** - Request Method (1-10) or Response Code (40-255)
**Message ID** – 16-bit identifier for matching responses
**Token** – Optional response matching token
## Dealing with packet loss
![](https://i.imgur.com/e9r8WnD.png)

Stop and Wait approach
Repeat a request after a time-out in case ACK (or RST) is not coming back
The timeout use an exponential backoff(duplicate at each failure)
### Back-Off Details
Initial time-out set to:
- Rand [ACK_TIMEOUT, ACK_TIMEOUT * ACK_RANDOM_FACTOR] ([2s, 3s])
When time-out expires and the transmission counter is less than MAX_RETRANSMIT (4)
- retransmit
- Increase transmission counter
- double the time-out value
The procedure is repeated until
- A ACK is received
- A RST message is received
- the transmission counter exceeds MAX_RETRANSMIT
- the total attempt duration exceeds MAX_TRANSMIT_WAIT (93s)
If there are more than 4 failures the process is aborted as there is some problem with the network. Also the dynamic is relaxed.
In IoT the client-server paradigm power is reversed as the servers are the one that receives information from the clients to gain information(push paradigms).
In CoAP the constraint sensors are on the server. In CoAP the limiting sensor nodes are the servers and the clients try to push things on.
## Proxyng and caching
![](https://i.imgur.com/Df1V75l.png)

We can cache the values of some measurements and the components can use the caching to response instead of asking to the other components. This is beneficial as we can avoid the communication with the CoAP server that is our bottleneck.
## COAP Observation
PROBLEM:
- REST paradigm is often “PULL” type, that is, data is obtained by issuing an explicit request 
- Information/data in WSN is often periodic/triggered (e.g., get me a temperature sample every 2 seconds or get me a warning if temperature goes below 5°C)
SOLUTION: use Observation on COAP resources
### Observation
![](https://i.imgur.com/PppdX82.png)

Server has the resources and is the limiting factor. In the option we set the Observe mode. The client is telling the server it wants to maintain registered on the updating of a resource. Doing so the server doesn't have to answer to multiple messages of the client but can simply send a message to the client each time the resource is updated. Use the same token with a different message ID.
This mode is beneficial when the dynamic of the resources is relaxed, if not the server still needs to send a lot of messages to the client.
## COAP Block Transfer
**PROBLEM**: avoid segmentation in the lower layers (IPv6), we doesn't want to fragment the messages has we have redundant information(header are replicated)
**SOLUTION**: COAP Block Transfer Mode 
- brings up fragmentation at the application layer, we create messages that remain in the maximum MTU(Message Transmission Unit)

![](https://i.imgur.com/PbdqqWE.png)

 Block2 Option added to messages
- nr=incremental block number within original data
- m=more blocks flag
- sz=block size
## Discovery & Semantics
Resource Discovery
- GOAL: Discovering the links hosted by CoAP (or HTTP) servers
		GET /.well-known/core?optional_query_string
- Returns a link-header style format
	URL, relation, type, interface, content-type etc.

# The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)

Very simple and flexible protocol to use. 
MQTT is a Client Server publish/subscribe messaging transport protocol.
More features:
- Simple to implement (especially at the sensor side)
- QoS Support
- Lightweight and bandwidth efficient
- Data agnostic: no syntax in the way messages are transmitted(can transmit text, binary etc...). The session size is not limited so it can be used also outside IoT
- Session awareness
MQTT continues the fact that IoT use a push paradigm, where objects generate data and push them on the internet to be used by others. This also implemented special operation in CoAP(observe mode, need to ask the object to continuosly send data when it is produced/the resource changes).
MQTT has this push paradigm in mind from the start(publish/subscribe mechanism).
The server is called the broker.
MQTT is really lightweight on client side
## Communication Pattern
Publish/Subscribe paradigm
- Clients don’t know each other
- One-to-Many paradigm
- Every client publishes & subscribes
- PUSH information paradigm compared to PULL’s one in COAP

![](https://i.imgur.com/PeQdsMG.png)

One to many communication paradigm(big difference to HTTP and CoAP that are one to one). There is also a complete separation between client that subscribe and client that publish(you don't need to know the identity of the client you subscribe to). It is only important the topic you subscribe, you are only interested in the content published not the one that published it. 
The broker knows all the clients that subscribed to a topic and will distribute the information of the topic when someone will publish something related to the topic. This is handly as it completely decouple the producer and the consumer, only focus on data production. The broker is an intermediate entity between who produces data and who consumes data.  
## MQTT Topics
The clients only need to express an interest in a topic(hierarchical string, composed of level separated by /). The idea of a topic is to express something that is eligible for a topic. 

Example:
```
deib/antlab/room5/temperature
```
- Each string is a topic level
- / is the separator of the levels
```
deib/antlab/ + /temperature
```
- wildcards allowed only when subscribing
- + is the wildcard symbol
- + can be used in multiple levels
- $\#$ is the multiple level wildcard
You cannot start with a / but with the rot level, maintain the levels below 7/8(for readability).
## MQTT Connections
- Each MQTT client opens one connection to the MQTT Broker
- Push capabilities 
- Works even through firewalls
Protocol born to transmit telemetry. The underline protocols were TCP and IP so MQTT uses TCP/IP as a base(in purest version of MQTT there is all the TCP stack). There is the need of a connection between client and server. Needs to know the IP of the server. Need to agree on who is the broker(only information in common, star topology with the broker in the center).  
### Open Connections
![](https://i.imgur.com/8Olvwhj.png)

CONNECT message fields:
- clientId “clientMatteo”(identify the client, can be given by the client or auto-generated by the server)
- cleanSession true (tells if the connection is new or is the continuation of a previous one)
- username (opt) “matteo”(only needed if the broker requires authentication)
- password (opt) “1234” (only needed if the broker requires authentication)
- lastWillTopic (opt) “matteo/temp” 
- lastWillQoS (opt) 1
- lastWillMessage (opt) “something wrong”
- keepAlive 30 (keeps up the connection for the specified time, if a client is not connected and do not complete actions)
CONNACK message fields:
- sessionPresent true
- returnCode 0-4
	0: everything ok
	1: unacceptable version
	2: id rejected
	3: server unavailable
	4: bad username and pwd
	5: unauthorized
## Publishing
![](https://i.imgur.com/P8IhbHB.png)

PUBLISH message fields
- packeId 2
- topicName “matteo/temp”
- QoS 1 (Quality of Service)
- retainFlag false
- Payload “temperature:30”
- dupFlag false (say if it is a retransmission of a packet)
### QoS 0: “at most once”
Most used QoS, fire and forget. No particular check on the message.
Best effort transfer (same reliability provided by the underlying transport protocol)
The underline protocol used is TCP that is a reliable protocol so whenever MQTT is used in its purest form there is no need to a QoS greater than 0 as TCP will do the checks for you.
### QoS 1: “at least once”
The MQTT client stores the message and keeps retransmitting it until it is acknowledged by the MQTT broker (message can be received multiple times)
 PUBACK message fields:
- packetId 2

![](https://i.imgur.com/YRqDTFt.png)

Wait for an acknowledgement. 
### QoS 2: “exactly once”
![](https://i.imgur.com/W3uPMlC.png)

Rarely used as it imposes overhead on the messages not justified if you use TCP as a protocol.
PUBREC, PUBREL, PUBCOMP message fields:
 - PacketId 2
- PUBLISH reception @ MQTT broker: process the packet accordingly, send
- PUBREC message back, store locally packetId to avoid duplicate processing
- PUBREC reception @ MQTT client: discard the initial packet and send PUBREL
- PUBREL reception @ MQTT broker: clear any current state and send PUBCOMP
Used only if you want to be sure that your publication goes to the broker only once.
## Subscribing
![](https://i.imgur.com/sIvAM9n.png)

The process is a mirroring of the publishing

![](https://i.imgur.com/aScYvkq.png)

In a single message you can specify multiple topics with their own QoS.
You receive a subscription acknowledgement for each topic with each code to say if there was a problem or not.
## Unsubscribing
![](https://i.imgur.com/C63eXRW.png)

Remove interest for a certain topic.
 UNSUBSCRIBE message fields:
 - packetId 2
- Topic1 “matteo/temp/1”
- Topic2  “kitchen/temp/2”
- ..........
- .......
UNSUBACK message fields:
- packetId 2
## Persistent Sessions
oooIn default operation mode when the client disconnects, all the client-related status at the broker is flushed (list of subscription, QoS pending messages, etc.)
In persistent sessions both client and broker maintain a session:
- Broker:
	- Existence of a session, even if there are no subscriptions, memorize also the client connections
	- All subscriptions
	- All messages in QoS 1 or 2 flow, which are not confirmed by the client
	- All new QoS 1 or 2 messages, which the client missed while it was offline
	- All received QoS 2 messages, which are not yet confirmed to the client
- Client
	- All messages in a QoS 1 or 2 flow, which are not confirmed by the broker
	- All received QoS 2 messages, which are not yet confirmed to the broker
That means even if the client is offline all the above will be stored by the broker and are available right after the client reconnects.
### Retained Messages
- Problem: publishing and subscribing are asynchronous processes
- A client subscribing to a topic pattern may not get any message on that topic until some other client publishes on it
- Retained messages are PUBLISH messages with the retained Flag set to one
- The broker stores locally the retained message and send it to any other client which subscribes to a topic pattern matching that of the retained message
These messages remains in the broker until a message of the same topic arrives(when you subscribe you will receive the latest message of the topic)
### Last Will Message
- The Last Will and Testament (LWT) notifies other clients about an hard disconnect by a specific client 
- Each client can specify its last will message when connecting to a broker
- The broker will store the message until it detects client hard disconnection
- The broker sends the message to all subscribed clients on the specific topic
- The stored LWT message will be discarded if a client disconnects gracefully by sending a DISCONNECT message.
If a producer client disconnect in a non graceful way the broker will understand this disruption and will send the last will message to all subscriber of the topic to advise that something is wrong.
#### LWT Message is sent when..
- An I/O error or network failure is detected by the server.
- The client fails to communicate within the Keep Alive time.
- The client closes the network connection without sending a DISCONNECT packet first.
- The server closes the network connection because of a protocol error.
If a client Id don't do activities in the keep alive time the broker will proceed to execute the LWT procedures. Since the keep alive timer is important it is also responsibility of the client to maintain the connection available.
##### Keepalive
- It is responsibility of the client to keep the MQTT connection active
- Upon expiration of the keepalive, if no other interaction has happened with broker, the client ”pings” the broker which “pings it back”
PINGREQ and PINGRESP messages have null payload(they only need to maintain the connection alive no real payload)
## MQTT-SN
Main differences
- Extended architecture with Gateways and Forwarders
- New gateway discovery procedures (and messages) 
- Some messages are more “compressed”
- Extended keepalive procedures to support sleeping clients
The idea is to have a traditional MQTT broker and then we have the broker that talks to MQTT-SN gateway that implements translation between MQTT(TCP) and MQTT-SN(UDP)

![](https://i.imgur.com/pIOCrJN.png)

The idea is to get rid of TCP/IP. TCP to broker and UDP to client.
The connection process is made much more simple.

![](https://i.imgur.com/7fgcXB4.png)

Split in 3 parts:
- CONNECT
- WILLTOPIC and WILLMSG
- CONNACK
This is done to have small exchange in time to reduce the time used on the sensor, reduce as much as possible the interaction between the client and the gateway. 
The connection setup is more flexible wrt the client.
Other change is in the topic names: uses much more smaller names to have small messages(fixing the amount of bytes given to a topic, 2 bytes identifier). There is a process called topic registration for a client to register a topic on a gateway receiving as a response the 2 bytes identifier to use in the next messages.
A gateway can ask for a registration to a client if the client reconnect or client register to # or + topics.
QoS levels becomes much more important as the protocol used is UDP. 
### QoS -1
Defined for super simple client that do not connect to topics, other clients or tries to register a topic, for clients that register and forget. No connection, no topic registration, the clients wakes up and knows what to do.
### Support for Sleeping Clients
The gateway is made aware of the devices that go to sleep to have a later delivery, otherwise the delivery can be lost as we are using UDP. Will buffer messages and send them to the clients when it wakes up.
