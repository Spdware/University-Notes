# Field Devices for IoT
The objects will be the Things in the IoT paradigm. 
Field device: device deployed somewhere(on the fields)
### Start from the Edge
A Sensor Node (or mote) is a device with the following capabilities:
- Sensing external phenomena: physical measurements, complex measurements(image in various spectrum), chemical sensing, movement sensing...
- Processing information: can process the data the node acquire, capability given by a processor(small, very cheap and require little energy to function). 
- Storing information 
- Communicating with other motes or devices
As in the name a sensor node is a device that is part  of a network can sense something from the device(first stage to derive data from the environment). 
These capabilities are given by a different part of the smart objects(subsystem).
Sometimes the smart objects can do some actions on the environment: in this case they are called actuators. The task done by an actuator can be:
-  Receiving Processing/storing input signals information from control devices
- Processing/storing information
- Acting on the industrial process
### IoT Building Block: Things
First thing to do when starting to think about an IoT application is to take the everyday object and think how to add sensors and computing capabilities. 
Need to understand what we need to sense and the relative requirements we need to meet to handle a good measurements.  
You also need to think what constraint you have on:
- Wired/Wireless
- Flexibility/Programmability: important if the HW needs to support different versions of the firmware
- Integration/size/design: physical constraints that needs to be evaluated for the presentation of the device
- Budget: pay attention to products that are too costly
- H&M interfaces: allowing interactions with an user
Each of these constraints is critical for the goodness of our application and need to be taken care at the "thinking" stage as it narrow the HW you may use, making it easier to choose the right HW.

This, usually, is the HW architecture that we will encounter in an IoT system:
- Processor Subsystem: includes the processor and any memory
- Sensor subsystem: nowadays is a simple IO system in consumer systems, more complex in industrial
- Communication Subsystem
The three parts communicate together. 
#### Processor Subsystem

The processor subsystem is generally a MCU, very simple processing unit, based on the SHARC architecture. General idea: central unit for processing, memory for program instructions and a memory for storing data/variables. The data memory has an IO module to get samples data from the environment or to output the results of the calculations.
##### Microcontroller

a single Integrated Circuit (IC) used for a specific application 
**Processing**
- Central Processing Unit (CPU) – 4-bit to 64-bit processors
 - Clock generator (oscillator with quarz timing crystals)
**Storage**
- Random Access Memory (RAM): volatile, easy-to-access memory
- FLASH memory: non-volatile memory, block access only
- Electrical Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM): non volatile memory, byte access allowed
**Connectivity**
- Serial BUS: intra-IC connectivity (SPI, I2C)
- Input/Output interfaces
- Analog Digital Converters/Digital Analog Converters
Usually this design gives great flexibility and low-cost but these design have a low processing speed(Generally in IoT could not be needed an high processing speed)
##### Digital Signal Processors (DSPs)
A DSP is a specialized microprocessor designed to process discrete signals thorugh digital filters
DSPs can carry out complex mathematical operations at an extremely high efficiency,
processing hundreds of millions of samples, every second and providing real-time performance
Processor created with the purpose of doing floating points operations
##### Application Specific IC (ASIC) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA)
ASIC: integrated circuit (IC) that can be customized for a specific application
- High speed and customization
- High development cost
- Scarce flexibility
FPGA: similar high-level architecture as ASICs
- High speed (parallel programming allowed)
- Moderate reconfigurability
- High Complexity and cost
FPGA are generally high speed and can have some reconfiguration(HW is multipurpose)
#### Sensor Subsystem
One of the main and common feature of these systems.

Need to digitalize the continuous signals from the real world. This is done by using an ADC. Sampling is the operations of taking values from the signal at fixed interval of time. After sampling we have a Quantizer as it converts a continuous signal in a discrete signal with a finite number of bits.
##### Sampling: Nyquist ADC
In order to reconstruct perfectly a continuous signal from its sample signal we need a frequency that is at least twice the bandwidth of the signal itself.
**Bandwidth (sampling rate):** inverse of the sampling interval, $f_s=1/T$
$$f_s = 2B \text{ , B signal bandwidth}$$
##### Quantization
Taking the continuous values of your signal and approximating it with a finite number. We cannot represent a continuous value so we need to approximate it. 
$V_{in}$ is approximated by a digital codeword, each codeword is associated with a value($2^{bit}$ possible words).

The quantization error is at most 1/2 of the least significant bit.

The more bits you have the more the maximum quantization error is negligible.

### IoT Hardware Breakdown
![](https://i.imgur.com/16Wcnc1.png)

There are multiple solution from cheap solutions but with little computational power to more expensive but more capable structures.
### Single Board Computer + OS
The OS in IoT is not a complete OS but is the code necessary to run our application correctly and access the HW resources correctly.
Nowadays we have two situations regarding the OS of our system:
- Embedded in the HW
- Tiny layer where we insert the OS

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZmJb6c3.png)

We have a "battle" for the OS on our board as there are a great amount that can satisfy our needs.
# What if Sensors/Actuators are Wireless?
No cables means no power and no wired connectivity
### Wire-free Sensor: Energy efficiency becomes a MUST
Sensor node has limited power source
Sensor node LIFETIME depends on BATTERY lifetime
- Goal: Provide as much energy as possible at smallest cost/volume/weight/recharge
- Problem: recharging and/or battery replacement may be immaterial or too expensive
Options
- Primary batteries – not rechargeable
- Secondary batteries – rechargeable, only makes sense in combination with some form of energy harvesting
Recharging/Switching batteries can be a problem in some cases so we need to create the most efficient system possible to reduce these needs.
### Power Consumption Dissected
![](https://i.imgur.com/8nlPjkT.png)

The, especially if wireless, communication subsystem dominates the consumption.
So we need to use it the least amount of time possible and switch off the communication channel as soon as possible, also using the smallest message possible. 
#### The “Idle Listening” Problem
 The power consumption of “short range” wireless communications devices is roughly the same whether the radio is transmitting, receiving, or simply ON,
“listening” for potential reception (IEEE 802.15.4, Zwave, Bluetooth, WiFi)
Circuit power dominated by core, rather than large amplifiers
Radio must be ON (listening) in order receive anything.
- Transmission is infrequent.
- Listening (potentially) happens all the time
$\Rightarrow$ Total energy consumption dominated by idle listening
To minimize the amount of time you stay up you schedule the operations(reception can happens only in determined moment of time).
##### Power: Model of operation

##### Energy Consumption for Communication

##### On the emitted power
The emitted power is often a tunable parameter
Good practice is to set it to the lowest value which allows for “good reception”
The quality of the reception process is “measured” in terms of:
- Bit Error Rate (BER): fraction of bit not correctly received(“1” for a “0” or viceversa)
- Packet Error Rate (PER): fraction of packet not correctly received
- PER/BER relation (packet of length l, independent errors):
$$PER =1-(1-BER)^l$$
The emitted power depends also on distance and on the quality we wants to give to the transmission(to measure the quality we can use the BER, PER ...)

### Signal to noise and Interference Ratio
BER (and PER in turn) depends on the “level of noise” in the TX/RX channel, which, in
turn, depends on the transmitted/received power:
$$SINR = 12\log_{10}(\frac{P_{recv}}{N_0+\sum_{i=1}^k I_i}),N_0\text{ is the Thermal noise: KTB}$$
BER can be computed once given the specific TX/RX channel (modulation) and the
specific SINR
### Receiver Sensitivity
Each receiver is characterized by a sensitivity parameter
The minimum input signal power needed at receiver input to provide adequate SNR at receiver output to do data demodulation
Knowing such parameter, one can find the required emitted power at the transmitter by inverting the propagation law of the channel to get to required emitted power
We can use models equations to tune the power we are sending to a receiver to enable it to better understand the signal, always minimizing the energy consumption.
### Processing Power Consumption
 CPU power dissipation due to:
 $$P_p = P_{dyn} + P_{sc} + P_{leak}$$
Where:
- $P_{dyn}=CfV^2 : Job done$
	- C: capacitance(~ 0.67nF)
	- f: frequency
	- V: voltage
- $P_{sc}$: Short circuits
- $P_{leak}$: leakage

 Rough Comparison:
- Energy cost of transmitting 1 KB a distance of 100 m is approx. equal to executing 3 Million instructions by a 100 million instructions per second processor.
Local data processing (if possible) is crucial in minimizing power consumption in a multi-hop network
Since processing is much cheap than transmission is better to do local processing as much as possible.
### Memory and Sensing Power Consumption
Power consumption due to memory access:
- Crucial part is FLASH memory, Power for RAM almost negligible
- FLASH writing/erasing is expensive (e.g., on Mica motes - Reading: 1.1 nAh per byte, writing: 83.3 nAh per byte)
Power consumption due to sensing:
- Highly dependent on the sensor
- Rough model for ADC:
$$P_S \thicksim f_S 2^n$$
### Design Guidelines
 Do not run motes at full operation all the time:
- If nothing to do, switch to power safe mode
- Question: When to throttle down? How to wake up again?
Typical modes
- Controller: Active, idle, sleep
- Radio mode: Turn on/off, transmitter/receiver, both
Tries to sleep the most of the time, do not operations that aren't necessary. 
##### Optimize power consuimptions. 
Energy aware software:
- Power aware OS: dim displays, sleep on idle times, power aware scheduling
Energy aware packet forwarding
- Radio automatically forwards packets at a lower level, while the rest of the node is asleep
Energy aware wireless communication
- Exploit performance energy tradeoffs of the communication subsystem, better neighbor coordination, choice of modulation schemes
