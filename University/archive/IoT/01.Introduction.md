# Introduction and Impact
## The "Classical" Internet

 Mostly Static Clients accessing “Well Known” services in the network
 Internet is the interconnection of the different types of networks. In all networks we have information. The goal of Internet is to share/get information. Each information is digital. Each server has a name(translated in IP by the DNS). It is a full paradigm. 
 HTTP: client contact a server and do a GET request.
## Transition Steps
Internet Clients are going Mobile(access everywhere but needs to account for the energy consumption). The mobile device become also to produce data and not only requesting data. Upload operation drastically change the paradigm.
 Mobile Clients with Sensing and Actuating capabilities
- Client themselves become information/service producers
## IoT: What is it?
“A global network infrastructure, linking physical and virtual objects through the
exploitation of data capture and communication capabilities. This infrastructure includes existing and evolving Internet and network developments.....” (CASAGRAS)
“A world where physical objects are seamlessly integrated into the information
network, and where the physical objects can become active participants in business
processes..” (Future Internet EU Initiative)
“A world-wide network of uniquely addressable interconnected objects, based on standard communication” (ETP-EPOSS)
These definitions come from different backgrounds but have in common:
- Physical objects/Physical everyday objects
- Remote control of something
- Communication between objects also using existing internet
- Data: values of a interconnected communication
- Pervasive by design: finds IoT systems in all types environments
## First Wave of IoT
Veichles: big area where IoT is being developed. From Intra-veichle to wireless transmission(less weight for cables). New concept of vehicular sensors.
Humans: health, wellness, fitness...
Smart Cities/Domotics: optimize consumption, cleaness, quality of life...
IoT system stay the same in all these areas
## IIoT vs IoT

Consumer IoT are application thought for people so are characterized by low cost and  low reliability.
Industry IoT are characterized by high cost and high reliability(both communication technology and objects need to be robust).
In IIoT cyber security must be central, no temporary disruption allowed, need to coexist with legacy technologies, robustness resiliency and availability are a must, User experience and usability not a must.
## IoT Building Blocks and Challenges

When you want to build an IoT system you identify an object/application, make it "smart" with sensors and then connect with internet. Then the object will start to produce/consume data. 
Horizontally you have the concept of Security and Resilience/Robustness.
### Reliability/Robustness
Hardware level:
- Data collected must be reliable/consistent
- Device must live in harsh environment
Software level
- Communication protocols must be robust to failures, changing topologies, interferences, etc.
- Self healing, self configuration functionalities needed
