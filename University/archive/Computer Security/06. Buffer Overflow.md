## Binary Formats
Holds information about:
1. how the file is organized on disk,
2. how to load it in memory.
3. Executable or library?
	a. Entry point (if executable).
4. Machine class (e.g., x86)
5. Sections
	a. Data
	b. Code
	c. ...

## ELF Binaries
![](https://i.imgur.com/Wx7B0ZX.png)

Program headers tells you where the files will be loaded in memory
ELF header tells you the semantic of the files.
## Process Creation in Linux
When a program is executed, it is mapped in memory and laid out in an organized manner.
1. The kernel creates a virtual address space in which the program runs.
2. Information is loaded or mapped from exec file to newly allocated address space:
	a. The loader and dynamic linker, called by the kernel, loads the segments defined by the program headers.
3. The kernel sets up the stack and heap and jumps at the entry point of the program.

## The Code and the Stack
![](https://i.imgur.com/IXZVM0D.png)

## Recall on Registers
**General Purpose**: Common mathematical operations. They store data and addresses (EAX, EBX, ECX)
- ESP: address of the last stack operation, the top of the stack.
- EBP: address of the base of the current function frame
	 relative addressing
**Segment**: 16 bit registers used for keep track of segments and backward compatibility (DS, SS)
**Control**: Control the function of the processor (execution)
- EIP: address of the next machine instruction to be executed
**Other**
- EFLAG: 1 bit registers, store the result of test performed by the processor
### Code Excercize
```C
int foo(int a, int b) {
int c = 14;
c = (a + b) * c;
return c;
}

int main(int argc, char * argv[]) {
int avar;
int bvar;
int cvar;
char * str;
avar = atoi(argv[1]);
bvar = atoi(argv[2]);
cvar = foo(avar, bvar);
printf("foo(%d, %d) = %d\n", avar, bvar, cvar);
return 0;
}
```

```bash
./executable_file 10 20
```

This code is bound to explode as there is not a bound to the gets/puts buffer dimension.
The foo() function receives two parameters by copy.
- How does the CPU pass them to the function?
- Push them onto the stack!
The call Instruction
- The CPU is about to call the foo() function.
- When foo() will be over, where to jump?
- The CPU needs to save the current EIP.
- Where does the CPU save the EIP?
	 On the stack!
$$\text{call 0x8048484 <foo> ==}\begin{cases}  
   \text{push \%eip} & \\  
   \text{jmp 0x8048484} \rightarrow \text{ foo()} &  
\end{cases}$$
**Function Prologue**
When a function is called,
- its activation record is allocated on the stack.
- The control goes to the function called.
When a function ends,
- it returns the control to the original function caller
We need to remember where the caller’s frame is located on the stack, so that it can be restored once the callee's will be over.
The CPU needs to remember where main()'s frame is located on the stack, so that it can be restored once foo()'s will be over.
The first 3 instructions of foo() take care of this.

**Note: Beware of compiler optimizations**
```bash
$ gcc -O0 -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2
-ggdb -march=i386 -m32 -fno-stack-protector
-no-pie -z execstack test.c
```
By default, modern compilers use 16-bytes ($2^4$) stack-boundary alignment (for performance reasons on certain CPUs (e.g., Pentium III/PentiumPro (SSE)).
With gcc, if you compile without __-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2__ ($2^2$, or 4 bytes), the resulting code will allocate 16 bytes at a time, even or smaller data types.
**Recall**
When a function is called,
- its activation record is allocated on the stack.
- The control goes to the function called.
When a function ends
- it returns the control to the original function caller
We must restore the caller’s frame on the stack.
**Function Epilogue**
The CPU needs to return back to main()'s execution flow.
The last 2 instructions of foo() take care of this.

## Stack smashing
First mention in 1972 in report ESD-TR-7315
Widely popularized in 1994 by aleph1
	 "[Smashing the stack for fun and profit](http://phrack.org/issues/49/14.html#article)" (must read!)
**foo()** allocates a buffer, e.g., char buf[8]
**buf** is filled without size checking
Can easily happen in C:
- strcpy, strcat
- fgets, gets
- sprintf
- scanf
Problem EIP is a data in the stack so it can be changed(Really big problem, shouldn't be there to begin with). This is done by creating an out of bound on the stack. If we break the allocated stack we write from bottom to up and we modify the values in the stack/destroy them.
Pretty much everything that read strings without a bound is a vulnerability. This is fixed by using the counting version of the previous functions. gets is the only one that doesn't have a counting version so it has dropped from the C standard library(only case in history).

### Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities
```C
int foo(int a, int b)
{
int c = 14;
char buf[8];
gets(buf); //security bug -> vulnerability
c = (a + b) * c;
return c;
}
```

```bash
$ ./executable-vuln
ABCDEFGHILMNOPQRSTUV
Segmentation fault
```

Segmentation fault as we eat up  the space allocated for the buf.

My be lucky and crash on the EBP.
### Where do we jump to, instead?
Problem: We need to jump to a valid memory location that contains, or can be filled with, valid executable machine code.
Solutions (i.e., exploitation techniques):
- Environment variable
- Built-in, existing functions
- Memory that we can control
	 The buffer itself <~ we will go with this
	 Some other variable
You would like to jump where there is code you want to execute(also as an attacker). If you want to simply insert code you can insert it in the environment variable space as it can fit also entire programs, or you can jump to spaces where you have authorization to execute something.
You can also load standard C library functions as they are loaded in memory(doing so you can run functions/command easily).
Some solution of sort: pages are either writable or executable not both.
## Stack Smashing 101
Let's assume that the overflowed buffer has enough room for our arbitrary machine code.
How do we guess the buffer address?
- Somewhere around ESP: gdb?
- unluckily, exact address may change at each execution and/or from machine to machine.
- the CPU is dumb: off-by-one wrong and it will fail to fetch and execute, possibly crashing. 
**Problem of Precision**
Need to be precise as a miscalulation of 1 Byte can be deprimental to your exploit(can cope with it with some methods, in x86 NOP operations are 1 Byte long, so they are perfect to move around the buffer).
Reading the ESP Value in Practice
Plan A. Use a debugger: (gdb) p/x $esp 0xbffff680
Plan B. Read from a process
**Note: Be Careful with Debuggers**
Notice that some debuggers, including gdb, add an offset to the allocated process memory. So, the ESP obtained from gdb (Plan A) differs of a few words from the ESP obtained by reading directly within the process (Plan B). Anyways, we still have a problem of precision.

The longer the NOP sled the better you can exploit.
### NOP Sled Explained
A “landing strip” such that:
- Wherever we fall, we find a valid instruction
- We eventually reach the end of this area and the executable code
Sequence of NOP at the beginning of the buffer
- NOP is a 1-byte instruction (0x90 on x86), which does nothing at all
**Where to Jump**
Jump to “anywhere within the NOP sled range”
**What to Execute? 5h311c0d3**
Historically, goal of the attacker: to spawn a (privileged) shell (on a local/remote machine)

(Shell)code: sequence of machine instructions (that are needed to open a shell)
In general, a shellcode may do just anything (e.g., open a TCP connection, launch a VPN server, a reverse shell).
http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/
Basically: execute execve("/bin/sh")
Using netcat you can have a shell with a stack attached, can run shells on remote machines and have reverse shells where you can have the shells do what you want.
**$ man execve**
int execve(const char *pathname,char *const argv[],char *const envp[])
Executes the program referred to by pathname.
Family of system calls (i.e., OS mechanism to switch context from the user mode to the kernel mode), needed to execute privileged instructions.
In Linux, a system call is invoked by executing a software interrupt through the int instruction passing the 0x80 value (or the equivalent instructions in nowadays
processors).
You call execve as it is the only instruction that is always loaded in memory no matter how much you strip the standard C library.
#### Calling convention
In Linux, a system call is invoked by executing a software interrupt through the int instruction passing the 0x80 value (or the equivalent instructions):
```
1. movl $syscall_number, eax
2. Syscall arguments //GP registers (ebc, ecx,
edx)
a. mov arg1, %ebx
b. mov arg2, %ecx
c. mov arg3, %edx
3. int 0x80 //Switch to kernel mode
Syscall is executed
```

#### Writing shellcode
Unless we want to write the shellcode in assembly, we code it in C and then we "compose" it by picking the relevant instructions only.
1. Write high level code
2. Compile and disassembly
3. Analyze assembly
	a. Clean up code
4. Extract Opcode
5. Create the shellcode
**Problem**
How to get the exact (not approximate) ADDRESS of /bin/sh if we don't know where we are writing it in memory?
**Trick**. The call instruction pushes the return address on the stack (e.g., saved EIP).
Executing a call just **before declaring the string** has the **side effect** of leaving the address of the string (next IP!) on the stack.
I'm using code to asking the machine where I am in the stack(I can do this at the start of the exploit). Usually you don't have the call function but can access the CPU context. 

**Memory That we Can Control**
We considered the overflowed buffer, but can be done with other memory areas too
PROS:
- Can do this remotely (input == code)
CONS:
- Buffer could not be large enough
- Memory must be marked as executable
- Need to guess the address reliably
## Alternative Exploitation Techniques
Recall: We need to jump to a valid memory location that contains, or can be filled with, valid executable machine code (shellcode).
Solutions (i.e., exploitation techniques):
- Memory that we can control
	 The buffer itself DONE
	 Some other variable
- Environment variable
- Built-in, existing functions
