## What is Access Control?
A RESOURCE is either a mass data storage or a peripheral socket.  
A binary decision:
- Access either allowed or denied
- What could possibly go wrong?
Scale goes wrong!
- You cannot explicitly list the answers
- Need to condense them in rules
Questions
- How do we design the access rules?
- How do we express the access rules in practice?
- How do we appropriately apply them?
Access control is the decision if an user can access a resource. This decision needs to be taken for a lot of user that can also change their privileges.
## Who Does it? The Reference Monitor
Enforces access control policies ("who does what on which resource"). All modern kernels have a reference monitor implementation.
Requirements for the Reference Monitor:
- Tamper proof
- Cannot be bypassed
- Small enough to be verified/tested as bugs are vulnerability
The reference monitor is the enforcer of the access policies, typically a part of the kernel. 
### Authentication & Authorization
The reference monitor has to find and evaluate the security policy relevant for the given request:
- verifies the identity of the principal making the request
- decides whether access is granted or denied.
“Easy” in centralized systems but in distributed systems...
- how to find all relevant policies?
- how to make decisions if policies may be missing?

## Access control models
Can be roughly divided in
- Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
- Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Difference between DAC and MAC
- who assigns privileges
RBAC abstracts roles from identities
### Discretionary Access Control
Resource **owner** discretionarily decides its access privileges
- Stefano creates a file
	 Assigns Federico the privilege of reading it
If this sounds “normal” it is because all off-the-shelf OSs implement DAC
Examples of DAC systems
- UNIX
	-  Subjects: users, groups
	- Objects: files (everything, really)
	- Actions: read, write, execute
- Windows (not the 95/98/ME branches)
- Subjects: with roles instead of groups, multiple ownership of users and roles over files
- Objects: files and “other” resources
- Actions: delete, change permissions, change ownership.
A user can be in multiple permission groups.

#### General model of DAC systems
We need to model the following entities:
- Subjects who can exercise privileges (a.k.a., rights)
- Objects on which privileges are exercised
- Actions which can be exercised
Protection state: a triple (S, O, A)
- A: matrix with S rows and O columns
- A$[s,o]$: privileges of subject s over object o

|             | **file1**        | **file2**        | **directoryX**   |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| **Alice**   | Read             | Read, Write, Own |                  |
| **Bob**     | Read, Write, Own | Read             | Read, Write, Own |
| **Charlie** | Read, Write      |                  | Read             |
Usually we design the fact that changing the state is loop-free
In Windows you also have to take care of inconsistencies as the Allow/Deny is done wit two bits.
Databases stores the triplets to have a log of the operations(in a separate table as users cannot access these tables)
CAPABILITY LIST: can be useful to have a list of who do what in a single scoop
#### Transitions in the HRU model
Basic operations
- create (or destroy) subject $<s>$
- create (or destroy) object $<o>$
- add (or remove) $<permission>$ into [s,o] matrix
Transitions: sequences of basic operations
- "create file (subject u; file f)":
	 create object f
	 add “own” into [u,f]
	 add “read” into [u,f]
- Is this right? No, we need to check if f existed before, otherwise u would be stealing it away!
- We need an “if” construct for modeling transitions
#### Safety problems
From an initial configuration, given a sequence of transitions, can s obtain a right r on f?
- Obviously, yes if the owner o allows it!
- But, if the owner does not?
	If it happens, set of commands **unsafe by design**!
More formally
- Given an initial protection state and set of transitions, is there any sequence of transitions that leaks a certain right r (for which the owner is removed) into the access matrix?
- If not, then the system is safe with respect to right r
In a generic HRU model (with infinite resources): undecidable problem
- Decidable in mono-operational systems, (substantially useless, e.g., you cannot create a file and own it)
- ... or if subjects/objects are finite.
#### Common DAC Implementations
- Reproduction of HRU models
- Access matrix is a sparse matrix
- Alternative implementations:
	- Authorizations table: records non-null triples S-O-A, typically used in DBMS
	- Access Control Lists: records by column (i.e., for each object, the list of subjects and authorizations)
	- Capability Lists: records by row (i.e., for each subject, the list of objects and authorizations)
#### Access Control vs Capability Lists
Access Control Lists
- Focus on the object
- ACLs ≡ columns of the access control matrix 

| fun.com | Alice: {exec} | Bill:{exec,read,write} |
| ------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
Capability Lists
- Focus on the subject
- Capabilities ≡ rows of the access control

| Alice | edit.exe:{exec} | fun.com{exec,read} |
| ----- | --------------- | ------------------ |
##### ACLs vs Capability Lists

| ACLs                                                           | Capabilities                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| efficient with **per object** operations                       | efficient with **per subject** operations                        |
| Most common case                                               | Usually **objects** change and **subjects** stay, so inefficient |
| Some systems (e.g., POSIX) use abbreviated<br>ACLs             | Capabilities are optional in POSIX (Linux and BSD)               |
| Cannot have multiple owners (partially achievable via groups). |                                                                  |
#### General DAC shortcomings
- Cannot prove safety
- Control access to objects but not to the data inside objects (granularity)
	- Susceptible to malicious user problem
	- Susceptible to trojan horse problem: malicious program running with privileges of the user
- Problems of scalability and management
	- each user-owner can potentially compromise security of the system with their own decisions
### Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
Idea: do not let owners assign privileges.
Privileges are set by a security administrator:
- E.g., defines a classification of subjects (or "clearance") and objects (or "sensitivity").
The classification is composed of:
- A strictly ordered set of secrecy levels.
- A set of labels.
Labels are orthogonal to the classification in a mathematical way: we can discern the different authority with a reticle.
Classification = partial order relationship.
Dominance in a lattice is defined as:
$$\{C_1,L_1\} ≥ \{C_2,L_2\} ⇔ C_1≥C_2 \text{ and } L_2 ⊆ L_1$$

Administrator are critical users that can read/write anything so they need to be trusted.
We have confidientality by segregation. 
Decouple identity to role, insert a table between user and roles(scalability purpose).
#### Bell-LaPadula Model (BLP)
Defines two MAC rules:
1. Rule 1 (no read up, "simple security property") A subject s at a given secrecy level cannot read an object o at a higher secrecy level.
2. Rule 2 (no write down, "star property") A subject s at a given secrecy level cannot write an object o at a lower secrecy level.
Defines one DAC rule:
3. Rule 3 (Discretionary Security Property) states the use of an access matrix to specify the discretionary access control.
**Tranquility property**: secrecy levels of objects cannot change dynamically.
**Result**: monotonic flow of information toward higher secrecy levels
- need of trusted subjects who can declassify or sanitize documents
Limitations: does not address integrity. There are other models for integrity, e.g.

## Conclusions
Access control, or authorization, defines subjects, objects, and actions in a system.
Access control models define how actions are (un)assigned to subjects and objects.
DAC are more common and “natural” than MAC, but can coexist.
