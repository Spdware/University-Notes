# Basic Security Requirements
The so-called CIA Paradigm for information security states three requirements:
- Confidentiality: information can be accessed only by authorized entities. Meaning physical segregation or cryptography(No read from someone not authorized)
 - Integrity: information can be modified only by authorized entities, and only in the way such entities are entitled to modify it.
- Availability: information must be available to all the parties who have a right to access it, within specified time constraints. 
**"A" conflicts with "C" and "I": engineering problem.**
We need to find methods to guarantee these three properties.
## Security as an Engineering Problem
We need some concepts to frame it:
- Vulnerabilities: something that allows to violate one of the constraints of the CIA paradigm. The weakest thing is the problem.
- Exploits: a specific way to use one or more vulnerabilities to accomplish a specific objective that violates the constraints. A technical means to violate the guarantees

To overcome these problems we can adapt new technologies to prevent/extend the period of time needed to violate a system. These prevention should be a functional requirement.
- Assets: what you protect. The security level is not implied by the protection level as there is something that can be valuable but no one care or something valuable that have high protection level but requires an higher security level as the security can increase.
	-  Examples: hardware (e.g., laptops, computers, phones), software (e.g., applications, operating system, db), data (e.g., data stored in a db), reputation (think about social media)
- Threats: Potential violation of CIA; circumstance potentially causing a CIA violation. Should be carefully evaluated in kind and effectiveness.
	- Examples: Denial of service (e.g., software or hardware unavailable), identity theft (e.g., unauthorized access to software/data), data leak (e.g., unauthorized release of data).
**Attacks and Threat Agents**
**Attack**: is an intentional use of one or more exploits with the objective of compromising a system's CIA.
- Examples: attaching a "malicious" PDF file to an email, picking a lock to enter a building.
**Threat Agent**: whoever/whatever may cause an attack to occur.
- Examples: malicious software or individual attaching a file, thief trying to enter a building
 **Attacker**: whoever/whatever performs the attack.
 **Hacker**: someone with an advanced understanding of computers and computer
networks, and willingness to learn "everything."
 **Attacker != Hacker**
 Security Professionals (white hats):
- Identifying vulnerabilities.
- Developing exploits.
- Developing attack-detection methods.
- Develop countermeasures against attacks.
- Engineer security solutions.
 
 
 - Risks: statistical and economical evaluation of the exposure to damage because of the presence of vulnerabilities and threats.
 $$Risk = Asset \times Vulnerabilities \times Threats$$
 For preparing for adversarial behaviour is to know completely the threats as you can prepare in advance, the other guys doesn't know how you will defend. Most of the times Threats are independent variables and Assets and Vulnerabilities that are controllable and dependent variable as The more you cover the vulnerabilities the more a system will cost. 
 **Security:** (reduction of vulnerabilities + damage containment)
### Security vs. Cost Balance
Direct costs:
- Management
- Operational: the slower your operations are the less people can work
- Equipment
Indirect costs (more relevant):
- Less usability
- Slower performance: you need extra checks
- Less privacy (due to security controls)
- Reduced productivity (users are slower)
More money ‚áè More security
Throwing more money at the problem will not necessarily solve it
### Trust and Assumptions
Trust: I will take it for granted, I can assume that parts of the system are secure. A trusted object for you cannot be trusted by someone else.
# Conclusion
Security is a complex engineering problem of balancing conflicting requirements.
A system with limited vulnerabilities but with a high threat level may be less secure than a system with many vulnerabilities but with low threat level.
Attackers, hackers, pirates, ..., are very distinct
concepts and should not be confused.
Security is a cost.
