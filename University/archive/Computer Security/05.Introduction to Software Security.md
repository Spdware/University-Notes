# Software security fundamentals
Good software engineering: meet requirements
- Functional requirements
	 Software must do what it is designed for.
- Non-functional requirements
	 Usability
	 Safety
	 Security
- Creating inherently secure applications is a fundamental, yet often unknown, skill for a good developer or software engineer.
	 Creating secure software is hard.
## Software has Vulnerabilities
Software should implement the specifications
- Unmet specification == software bug
- Unmet security specification == vulnerability
A way to leverage a vulnerability to violate the CIA is called exploit.
- Vulnerability != exploit. If the vulnerability is not reachable by an attacker is not exploitable **BUT** it should be taken care of when discovered

NON DISCLOSURE: vulnerabilities weren't tell to others than friends, tells companies that there are vulnerabilities
DISCLOSURE: company started liking and using the free labor given by hobbyst, but then exploits, moreso if they give admin access, were sold on the black market and companies started Bug Bounties(paying for the discovery of an exploit in their code)
# Vulnerability and Exploit Example
## Processes in UNIX-like systems.

ls is owned by the root and the user can "borrow" the file to run the process. Real UID let you know who is the real owner of the file.
Default of RUID: who runs the exe
EUID: effective user against which the DAC checks are done.

DAC checks in UNIX systems are run in an if that checks the RUID: this is done as the RUID of the system administrator is 0(sysadmin doesn't goes through the DAC checks).
FIle creation header:
- set-uid
- s-gid
- sticky bit: done has the permission level of the directory are passed to the file(in UNIX)
- can have a bit that tells if the user can impersonate the owner
RUID is the only way to see who is the user as EUID and SUID can be overwritten with the UID of the owner of the file(for executing purpose).
SUID bit are legal and useful(borrowing ownership). The problem arises when the user wants to execute something else as the owner.
Security problem: the graphic cards are files in UNIX and if you can access as root and tell them to use as configuration file the password manager you will receive as error the line of the administrator password hash. To avoid this we want to change the EUID as soon as possible to remove privileges as soon as possible from users that do not need them. Drop the privileges as soon as possible.

You can also permanently drop permission changing the SUID and permanently burning the impersonation token(note that this only happens at each  execution of the program).

## Key Issues in Secure Design / Principle of Secure Design
1. Reduce **privileged** parts to a **minimum**.
2. KISS (Keep It **Simple**, Stupid).
3. Discard privileges definitively (i.e. SUID->RUID) as soon as possible
4. **Open design**: just as with Kerckhoffs principle, the program must not rely on obscurity for security.
5. Concurrency and race conditions are **tricky**.
6. Fail-safe and default deny. Better have a full deny and then allow the one that are needed.
7. Avoid the use of:
	- shared resources (e.g. mktemp).
	- unknown, untrusted libraries.
8. Filter the input and the output.
9. Do not write any own cryptographic primitives, password, and secret management code: use trusted code that has been audited already.
10. Use trustworthy RNGs such as /dev/[u]random
## Code Security by Example
We will see 5 main examples of (in)secure programming:
- Memory errors in desktop applications
	 Buffer overflow bugs
	 Format string bugs
- Code-injection bugs in web applications
	 SQL injection bugs
	 Cross site scripting bugs
	 CSRF
