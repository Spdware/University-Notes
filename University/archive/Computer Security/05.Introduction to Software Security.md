# Software security fundamentals
Good software engineering: meet requirements
- Functional requirements
	 Software must do what it is designed for.
- Non-functional requirements
	 Usability
	 Safety
	 Security
- Creating inherently secure applications is a fundamental, yet often unknown, skill for a good developer or software engineer.
	 Creating secure software is hard.
## Software has Vulnerabilities
Software should implement the specifications
- Unmet specification == software bug
- Unmet security specification == vulnerability
A way to leverage a vulnerability to violate the CIA is called exploit.
- Vulnerability != exploit. If the vulnerability is not reachable by an attacker is not exploitable **BUT** it should be taken care of when discovered

NON DISCLOSURE: vulnerabilities weren't tell to others than friends, tells companies that there are vulnerabilities
DISCLOSURE: company started liking and using the free labor given by hobbyst, but then exploits, moreso if they give admin access, were sold on the black market and companies started Bug Bounties(paying for the discovery of an exploit in their code)
