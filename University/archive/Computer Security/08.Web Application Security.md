## Typical Web Application Architecture
![](https://i.imgur.com/VFrmYPH.png)

This structure is done to move the logic to a machine that can be controlled by you and updated as you want without interpelling the client. You can write web application in every compiled languages you want. Typically you take the inputs from your user and print them as a page(HTML pages are basically text).
You are using a program that is fetching content to take parameters to execute in your server. Only advantage is that the user interface is a web browser. There are vulnerabilities that cut through the entire stack that will give complete access to your server.
## Web Applications: A Major Issue
Web applications are the current paradigm for software delivery
- On corporate intranets
- SAAS and cloud
Often exposed to public
- Think of public web services!
Built on top of a stateless protocol (HTTP)
- state “emulation” added on
HTTP has only weak authentication built in
- authentication “emulation” added on
They are used as updates are a matter of refresh the page and we can apply a subscription service more easily.
## The Untrustworthy Client
The golden rule of web application security is that the client is never trustworthy
We need to filter and check carefully anything that is sent to us
Examples:
- We cannot validate inputs on the client side, e.g. through JavaScript
- Variables, such as REFERRER, that the client is sending us, can lie
Client can be anything that can communicate with us through HTTP so we need to be careful. This means that whatever we do we need to be extras careful on how we implement it. We also need to take care of latency. 
Javascript is a clientside language that work and communicate between the server and client to enable some actions. So we can have small logic in the browser.
But this means that you are trusting the client to run logic application. This means that the parts that the client is going to run **ARE NOT security critical**.
## Developers vs. Attackers
Challenge: web developers see client as a(cooperative) part of the application!
**Developer's Mindset**:
- the user will click on the "Login" button
- as a result the browser will generate a correct GET request to /login.php?user=foo
- the server will process the request
**Attacker's Mindset**: we can craft a GET request to send /login.php?user=w|-|4t3v3r to the server
## HTTP is text based, so it's easy!
```HTTP
$ curl -v http://httpbin.org/get
> GET /get HTTP/1.1
> Host: httpbin.org
> User-Agent: curl/7.43.0
> Accept: */*

$ curl -v -H 'User-Agent: foobar-agent/7.43.1' http://httpbin.org/get
> GET /get HTTP/1.1
> Host: httpbin.org
> Accept: */*
> User-Agent: foobar-agent/7.43.1

$ curl --trace-ascii /dev/stdout --data user=foobar http://httpbin.org/post
0000: POST /post HTTP/1.1
0015: Host: httpbin.org
0028: User-Agent: curl/7.43.0
0041: Accept: */*
004e: Content-Length: 11
0062: Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
0093:
=> Send data, 11 bytes (0xb)
0000: user=foobar
```

If you need to pass parameters you MUST use post to not disclose the parameters to the world.
## Filtering is Hard
How to filter untrusted data?
Not easy (filter must be “correctly paranoid”)
The sequence of validation
1. **Allowlisting**, only allowing through what we expect
2. **Blocklisting**, on top of that discard known-bad stuff
3. **Escaping**, transform special characters into something else which is less dangerous
**Basic rule**: allowlisting is safer than blocklisting
Allowlisting is the way to go if there is nothing that will twist your data.
The importance of filtering is well known for security well before web application(example is phone calls in the 60s: there are 12 tones in europe but in america there are 15. Whistels can emit a tone similar to the 13th that is open a call to everyone so you can tone it in the receiver and start a call. This is still analogue. Phones were changed as adversarial input was critical).
Filtering is a matter to think what you want to exclude and program your code to exclude all the possible combination of this input.
### Example 1: Filtering a Phone Number
An input field that receives a phone number
Let’s start by designing a allowlist:
- Only numbers:
	 +39 fails
- Numbers and +, -, space
	More correct, most inputs will get through
Do we need to blocklist out something?
- Depends on the back end, but likely not
Do we need to escape something?
- Likewise, probably not
## Bad Things can Happen: XSS
Suppose now we have a simple blog app
- lets anybody post a comment
	 simple text field filled by visitor
- text displayed back to next visitors
If we do not apply any filter to what is inserted, an attacker could type:
```Javascript
<SCRIPT>
alert('JavaScript Executed');
</SCRIPT>
```
Popup would appear on next visitors’ screen
This is called **Cross Site Scripting**
This is bad as it is injecting javascript code in the application. So it is injecting your code into someone else program.
### Definition of XSS
Cross site scripting is a vulnerability by means of which client-side code can be injected in a page.
Three Types:
1. Stored XSS
2. Reflected XSS
3. Dom-based XSS
This depends on the path we use to inject the code
### Types of Cross-Site Scripting: Stored XSS (AKA Persistent)
The attacker input is stored on the target server in a database (e.g., in a message forum, visitor log, comment field).
Then a victim retrieves the stored malicious code from the web application **without that data being made safe to render in the browser** (e.g., visualizes the comment).
Example is billboard with images and comments, I use the comments to input javascript code into the client.
The problem is that the malevolent code is served to whoever is using the application and can be spreaded really fast. Problem is if you are a system administrator.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ULbqUXO.png)

### Types of Cross-Site Scripting: Reflected XSS (AKA Non-Persistent)
Client input (i.e., “request payload”) is returned to the client by the web application in a response (e.g., error message, search result)
The response includes some or all of the input provided in the request without being stored and made safe to render in the browser.
Vulnerable request handler in a web pages:

```HTTP
<?php
$var = $HTTP['variable_name']; //retrieve content from request's variable
echo $var;
 //print variable in the response
?>
```

Malicious crafted url:
http://example.com/?variable_name=`<script>alert('XSS');</script>`

![](https://i.imgur.com/NOdmoFE.png)

Whoever will use the application will propagate the malevolent code as the link is poisoned and the application logic only reproduce it.
Vulnerable program BUT there isn't an exploit on the server itself so it doesn't leave trace on the server and is only used by an unwilling client.
Do not click on weird links as they have code running in the browser once clicked.
### Types of Cross-Site Scripting: DOM Based XSS
User input never leaves the victim’s browser:
- The malicious payload is directly executed by client-side script (e.g., script that modifies/updates the DOM in-memory representation of a page including forms).
Script contained in the page:
```JavaScript
....
<script>
document.write("<b>Current URL</b> : " + document.baseURI);
</script>
....

```
Malicious crafted URL:
http://www.example.com/test.html#`<script>alert(1)</script>`

HTML is a content parenthesis language. I can create javascript code that changes the structure of the pages. I can insert something that insert javascript on the page and after is it loaded in the client. 

## The Power of XSS
Common reaction of web app coders: “So what? Scripting code is harmless in its sandbox, right?”. Well nowadays all your private information are on the browser so in the sandbox...ops.
Yyyyyeah, right, but:
- Cookie theft or session hijack
- Manipulation of a session and execution of fraudulent transaction
- Snooping on private information
- Drive by Download
- Effectively bypasses the same-origin policy
**Hint**: you may wish to browse with noscript
libpng once again is a mess and javascript can use it to breach the browser. Usually browsers fetch data from the user only if they are on the same origin.
## The Notion of Same Origin Policy
Implemented by all web clients
**Same Origin Policy** (SOP) = all client-side code (e.g., JavaScript) loaded from origin _A_ should only be able to access data from
origin _A_
- Origin = <PROTOCOL, HOST, PORT>
It's a simple concept. What could possibly go wrong?
Modern web has "blurry" boundaries
- [Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)
- Client-side extensions
Problem is that we can track whoever is asking for your pages and then log all the access to the page.
Browser extension store codes that is trusted as much as the browser as it is working on it.
### Example 2: Filtering Blog Comments
Input field that receives “a text comment”
Let’s start by designing a allowlist:
- Alphanumeric characters plus some punctuation
	 most inputs will get through
	 If this is the case, problem solved, you cannot write a XSS with this
- What if it’s a university page, or wikipedia, or a blog on mathematics?
	 We will need also characters such as < and >
Can we blocklist stuff?
- First reaction: blacklist```$<SCRIPT>!$?```
	 No, oh no, you don’t want to do that as you are removing parenthesis
#### `<SCRIPT>` Never Dies
First, it’s not just `<SCRIPT>` (equivalent tag)
○ also, e.g., `<APPLET>, <FRAME> and <IFRAME>`,
But even then:
	 What about these similar attributes?
`<img src="/doesnotexist" onerror="alert('JS!');">`
`<svg onload=alert('JS Executed');“>`
	 There’s a long list of event handlers...
Let’s blocklist every single one of them?
But, they can change with the evolution of the HTML spec! And even then...
**javascript: is a URL schema!**
What about these tags?
`<IFRAME SRC="javascript:alert('JavaScript Executed');">`
`<a href="javascript:alert('JS Executed');">click here!</a>`
We can blocklist “javascript:” too...
	 But then someone writes:
```JavaScript
<IFRAME SRC="javas
cript:alert('JavaScript Executed');">
```

And the browser strips `<CR>` and `<LF>` and executes it, while our blocklist doesn’t find it
Expand blocklist to take this into account
**Space: Final Frontier**
Then someone writes:
`<IFRAME SRC="javascript:alert('JavaScript Executed');">`
And the browser strips `<CR>` and `<LF>` and executes it, while our blocklist doesn’t find it
Expand blocklist to take this into account
**HTML (Paranormal) Entities**
Then what happens if I add a null HTML entity (09-12) ?
`<IFRAME SRC="javasc&#09;ript:alert('JavaScriptExecuted');">`
	... it works AGAIN :(
Filter null entities, then apply previous filters...
But I can do it with hexes, I can add zeroes, have fun writing this filter!
`<IFRAME SRC="javasc&#X0A;ript:alert('JavaScriptExecuted');">`
`<IFRAME SRC=javasc&#000010;ript:alert('JavaScriptExecuted');>`
**It’s a f-ing Conspiracy!**
OK. Now we filter out white spaces and blablas, we filter entities, we filter out the
javascript keyword...
Then you pick an "old random browser with a letter as a logo"® and:
`<IMG SRC="&{alert('JavaScript Executed')};">` gets executed :-(
Don’t ask why, I can’t even imagine that
Solution: filter out `&{`
##  Blocklisting is not the right way
Because what happens now if I write:
`<IFRAME SRC="java&{script{alert('JavaScriptExecuted')};">`
Filter strips the &{ and everything else gets executed :-(
tl;dr; blocklisting is not the appropriate way to handle this!
Want more? 
- https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_Filter_Evasion_Cheat_Sheet (partially outdated)
- https://html5sec.org/
**Additional set of Reasons (<=IE7)**
`<style TYPE="text/javascript"> ... </style>`
- Strip “text/javascript”, rinse, repeat
`<P STYLE="left:expression(eval('alert(\'JavaScriptExecuted\');window.close()'))">`
- Strip “STYLE”? But that’s a meaningful English word... and...
```HTML
<STYLE type=text/css>
@import url(http://server/very_bad.css);
@import url(javascript:alert('JavaScriptExecuted'));
</STYLE>

#### Example 2 (reprise)
Input field receives “a text comment”
Designed allowlist:
- Alphanumeric characters plus punctuation, including < and > and other special characters
Can we blocklist stuff?
- No, we don’t even go near there
Can we escape stuff?
- Yes! For instance we can swap > with its HTML safe equivalent &gt; and < with &lt; (other usefulexample: & becomes &amp;)
Escaping is the solution to try to differentiate all this mess.
```

##  Bad Things: SQL Injection

![](https://i.imgur.com/MlzFfjK.png)

The SQL injections answer to the question what is wrong with the image above.
```C
public void onLogon(Field txtUser, Field txtPassword) {
SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(String.Format(
"SELECT * FROM Users
WHERE username='{0}'
AND password='{1}';",
txtUser.Text, txtPassword.Text));
SqlDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader();
if(reader.HasRows())
IssueAuthenticationTicket();
else
RedirectToErrorPage();
}
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/zCMCvda.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/T4qAORY.png)

-- in SQL comments all the line after it, so if a user called zanero the system will return all the line of the user.
SQL injection gives free leeway to the hacker on portion of the system, the hacker can write code that is run on the main database also changing the query that the programmer doesn't want to run. You inject SQL code into the DB.

![](https://i.imgur.com/BFPN8Iz.png)

This can let you have a backup of the database printed on the page. The only limit is your fantasy and the point where you can inject the query.
#### Example 3: Filtering Login Fields
Input field receive strings
Let’s start by designing a whitelist:
- Username: alphanumeric characters plus "."
	 problem solved: cannot “break” a SQL query
- Password: eeek
	 the more we filter, the more we reduce keyspace
	 we can resort to blacklisting or escaping
Blacklist or Escape what ?
- ‘ ; -- at very least
- OR, AND, = ?
Remember the `<SCRIPT>` case?
-  OR —> ||
- AND —> &&
- = ~ like
**Gigantic Problem**: DO NOT give access to the selection of the table to the user, otherwise you are in a LOT of trouble as your entire database  is at risk.
## Retrieving Results and UNIONs
Suppose we are running the following query that displays
the results:
```SQL
SELECT name, phone, address FROM Users
WHERE Id=’userinput’;
```
If userinput is not filtered, we can do:
```SQL
SELECT name, phone, address FROM Users
WHERE Id=’’ or ‘1’=’1’;--’;
```
which will display all contents of that table
Another possible injection is:
```SQL
SELECT name, phone, address FROM Users
WHERE Id=‘’ UNION ALL SELECT
name,creditCardNumber,CCV2 from
CreditCardTable;--’;
```
- Will show contents of a different table (!)
- Will work only if the number and the data types of the columns are the same
The only thing I need for these queries is the DB schema. This is a problem as some DB contains their schema in another table probably called schema.
Also SQL has an encoder and so you can change the type to adapt or use constants to fill/remove attributes that you do not want.
Only GRANTS are the restriction to the attacker workflow, also use separate DBMS for web applications.
#### Example: a little app that stores exam results
Schema:
```SQL
CREATE TABLE users (
 CREATE TABLE results (
id INTEGER ,
 id INTEGER ,
user VARCHAR(128),
 username VARCHAR(128),
password VARCHAR(128),
 grade VARCHAR,
result VARCHAR,
 PRIMARY KEY (id))
PRIMARY KEY (id))
```
Insertion:
```SQL
INSERT INTO results VALUES (NULL,‘username’,‘grade’)
INSERT INTO results VALUES (NULL, ’s.zanero’, ‘18’)
```

## Injections on Inserts
```SQL
INSERT INTO results VALUES (NULL, ‘useriput’, '18')
```
A possible injection is:
```SQL
INSERT INTO results VALUES (NULL, 's.zanero', '30L')
--', '18')
```
INSERT allows multiple tuples as values. We can register the exam also for a friend of ours:
```SQL
INSERT INTO results VALUES (NULL, 's.zanero', '30L'),
(NULL, 'f.maggi', '30L') --', '18')
```

What you are chopping is a list so you can write multiple value, can inject a table full of content. The attacker can inject everything he wants as long as it respect the schema. 
**Subqueries** can be used too: let’s steal the admin password (from another table):
```SQL
INSERT INTO results VALUES (NULL, 's.zanero',
(SELECT password from USERS where user='admin'))
--', '18')
```
**You will need to retrieve this data** if it’s selected somewhere or try a blind injection!
## Blind Injections
Some SQL queries, such as the login query we saw, do not display returned values
- Rather, they do, or do not do, stuff based on the return value
We cannot use them to directly display data
- But we can play with their behavior to infer data
	 “Blind” SQL injections.
Curious about blind SQL injections?
[http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-europe-05/bh-eu-05-litchfield.pdf](Paper)

These are used to reveal data.
### Making Exploitation More Difficult
Input sanitization (validation & filtering)
Using prepared statements (parametric query) instead of building “query strings” (if
languages allows)
- $stmt = $db->prepare(SELECT * FROM users
WHERE username = ? AND password = ?” )
- $stmt -> execute(array($username,$psw));
- Variable placeholders that is not string concatenation.
Not using table names as field names
- can you see why? (Information leakage)
Limitations on query privileges
- Different users can execute different types of queries on different tables/DBs -> separate privileges from DB admin point of view
 Prepare statements are the solution. You pass a query to the DBMS that will prepare and optimize the query. So you will have tokens that are not treated as SQL anymore. If you have to write web application USE the prepared statements as they are faster and more secure that whatever you would write.
 If a language has an eval function you are cooked as now a string can become a program.
 ## Recap: Code Injection Problems
Conflicting requirements:
- Functional req: we need to mix code (e.g., HTML) with data (e.g., the blog comment)
- Security req: never mix code and data!
**Consequence**: if, at any point, there is a "parsing" routine (e.g., the browser's JavaScript parser) that reacts (e.g., prints something) on some "control sequences" found in the data, we have a vulnerability.
HTML.entity.escaping functions are really useful to find the escaping values and make them not metadata.
## Freudian Slips (Information leaks)
(Detailed) Error messages
- Good HCI practice
- Can create security issues
Debug traces active in production
- They are called debug traces for a reason! :-)
Sowdown is a search engine for admin panels that are public.
Insertion of user-supplied data in error
- XSS data injected in my code if not sanityzed
Side-channels
- E.g. "user not found" vs. "password mismatch"
- This is bad as communicate to the attacker that there is an user/password that correspond to what he inserted
Containers are useful as they limit the parent directory the attacker can access to. 
## Password Security
Everything we said about passwords still applies
Passwords should never, ever be stored in plain text in web applications
- minimize disclosure issues in case of breach
- salting + hashing (vs rainbow tables)
Password reset schemes need attention
- reset scheme is an alternate password
- typical: send reset link to registered email
- wrong: send temp password
- wrong: ask security question alone
We designed slow hashes to permit the usage to see if the messages are genuine(ARGON 2). Need to be fast enough to not annoy the user and slow enough to annoy the attacker(0.5 s is a good start).
You hash the password and salt strings that let you transform the deterministic hash algorithm in a random hash algorithm(either pass the password in a salted hash function or concatenate the password to the salt string and pass in a deterministic hash). This do not prevent target attack but precomputation.
Rainbow tables: tables with correspondence between passwords and their digest.
Resetting password should be done without the using of the old password to let the reset be evident and to not send the password in a email as it is in clear text and the server should store the digest and not the password itself. To close the vulnerability window you should send a email with a reset link valid for a short period of time.
## Bruteforcing Protection
Naïve solution: after n failed logon attempts, lock account
- Reverse bruteforcing: fix n-1 attempts and bruteforce accounts
Make accounts not-enumerable
Block IP address?
- IP address? Really?
- Is this a good idea at all? (hint: proxies, NATs)
- Can easily turn into DoS attack
Thoughts?
You can lock the number of attemps, but is not useful if your username are enumerable. So make users not enumerable or otherwise is password spraying day.
## Cookies
HTTP is stateless (grrrr!)
HTTP is almost unidirectional
- Client passes data to the server, but the server cannot “store” something on the client, except...
Except for “cookies”: client-side information storage; reliable mechanism to keep
stateful information.
- Original idea: site customization,
- Abuse: privacy violations
- Dangerous ideas: user authentication and sessions
Cookies are something that the browser uses to recognize you at each visit. 
The privacy problem is that the cookies are send voluntarily to the server, because they can be sent to the one that generate them. Problem is when you want to log in to multiple servers with the same cookie. If a malicious server send you a infected cookies that is sent to everyone, if this server is from a big company it is used by other to login you. 
To prevent this is the fact that you can cancel cookies and cookies cannot hop between browser. One extension to prevent this is privacy badger.
### Creating Sessions From Thin Air
Session creation and identification
(Authentication)
- Create and assign sessions to clients (Session ID)
Use long unique string to start the connection
### Cookies: Session creation and identification
![](https://i.imgur.com/dif4eba.png)

### Security Issues with Sessions
Prevent prediction of the token a client received, or will receive (next token)
- to prevent impersonation/spoofing attacks
- minimize damage of session stealing
Any token should have a reasonable expiration period
- NOT set in the cookies!
Cookie encryption (sensitive information) and storage (use a MAC to avoid tampering)
It is basically client storage abusing as the server is using client storage to store the cookie for future sessions. The server only need to encrypt the cookie and use a MAC to not let anyone tamper with it.
You can still do cookie stealing.
