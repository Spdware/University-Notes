**Identification:** put a label on something/someone. Usually is the login part.
**Authentication:** make sure that the label assigned to something/someone is correctly assigned. Need a proof to verify the identity.
Authentication can be unidirectional or bidirectional(mutual, you don't know if the server is the one you want to talk to).

![](https://i.imgur.com/nlKuyRQ.png)

Can happen between any entity:
- Human to human
- Human to computer
- Computer to computer
Foundation for the subsequent authorization phase
The bidirectional authentication may not be wanted, for example in google researches you may want to not be known to the servers(anonymous/pseudonymous authentication).
Firmware updates done properly does mutual authentication.
## Three Factors of Authentication
Something that the entity **knows** (to know)
1. Example: password, PIN, secret handshake.
Something that the entity **has** (to have)
2. Example: Door key, smart card, token.
Something that the entity **is** (to be)
3. Example: Face, voice, fingerprints.
Humans: (3) more used than (2), more used than (1).
Machines: (1) more used than (2), more used than (3).
Multi-factor authentication uses two or three factors. These are done to have more security and doing so having humanly separated factors(having the number where the security message is on the same phone the site you are trying to access is loosing the purpose of the multifactor authentication).
# The "to know" Factor
## Password
**Advantages**
- Low cost,
- ease of deployment,
- low technical barrier.
**Disadvantages**
Secrets can be
- stolen/snooped
- guessed(use the fact that the passwords aren't uniformly chosen)
- cracked (enumerated)
The last two disadvantages are the same only changes the way they are executed.
**Countermeasures** (i.e., costs)
Enforce passwords that
-  change/expire frequently
- are long and have a rich character set(in reality this doesn't do anything on the hardness of the guessing)
-  are not related to the user

## Why are Countermeasures Costs?
Humans are not machines
- Inherently unable to keep secrets, they are immaterial
- Hard to remember complex passwords
- Can’t pick unlimited countermeasures
	 how to choose?

## User Education and Password Complexity
User education: "human" == "weak link".
- enforce strong passwords in the process.
- enforce password expiration/change policies
- use password meters to balance usability.
Password complexity
- must h4v3 4 r1ch, ch4r4ct3r, s3t!
- mUsT hAvE a MiXeD cAsE
- muuuuuuust beeeeeeeee loooooooong enoooooough

![](https://i.imgur.com/hSyOZBQ.png)

Should not cap the length of the password as you are limiting the pool of passwords. 
## Secure Password Exchange
Authentication is about sharing a secret.
How to minimize the risk that secrets get stolen?
- use mutual authentication if possible
- use a **challenge-response** scheme
	 use random data to avoid replay attacks

![](https://i.imgur.com/WDxMDFR.png)

Number of problems:
- Authenticate on a remote server and not your pc. The communication can be spoofed and the attacker can impersonate you. You cannot put in the clear username and password(this was done in the 70s as the remote communication was done via dedicated cables inside buildings).
## Secure Password Storage
OS stores a file with usernames and passwords.
An attacker could try to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of this password file
How to minimize the risk that secrets get stolen?
- Cryptographic protection
	- Never store passwords in clear (hashing + salting to mitigate dictionary attacks)
- Access control policies (privileges to w/r)
- Never disclose secrets in password-recovery schemes.
Caching problem (information is held in intermediate storage locations)
If there is a proxy for the station you need to delete your traces after you are done(pay attention as Windows sysadmin).
# The "to have" Factor
User must prove that it possesses something.
**Advantages**
- Human factor (less likely to hand out a key),
- relatively low cost,
- good level of security.
**Disadvantages**                                        **Countermeasures**
- Hard to deploy,                                     none
- can be lost or stolen.                            use with second factor.

Example of password manager is KeyPass(is local), BItWarden
A password manager SHOULDN'T send the master password through internet and use it on disk/master memory. The master password have to be stored on disk **NEVER**. Never cache the password master.
It is something of a physical objects(computing object, small amount of memory and is on you). Problem is for non technical user is only an object and is subject to sharing(bad idea), we want to bind to the same mental category of key. Very cheap token(0.5$ to 2$). Design to be as good as it get(can use smartphone for contains various tokens). Typical tokens are the second authentication factor.
### Example Classic Technologies
One-time password generators:
- Secret key + counter synchronized with the host.
- Client: MAC-compute(counter, key).
- Host: MAC-verify(counter, key).
- Check that the counter is the expected one.
- The counter changes every 30–60 seconds.
**Application examples**: online banking, admin console (e.g., Amazon AWS).
Smart cards (also w/ embedded reader in USB keys)
- CPU + non-volatile RAM with a private key.
- The smart card authenticates itself to host via a challenge-response protocol.
- Uses the private key to sign the challenge.
- The private key does not leave the device.
- Should be tamper proof to some extent.
**Application examples**: credit cards (+PIN).
In this case is good to use MAC for authentication as the only problem would be the service impersonating itself(stupid).
If you are paranoid you implement the circuit with an HW accelerator for the MAC and an arithmetic calculator for the counter.
## Static OTP lists (cheaper alternative)
![](https://i.imgur.com/QfhiriZ.png)

Known to both client and host.
Host chooses a challenge: random numbers (e.g., "second digit of the 14th cell").
The client transmits the response (hopefully, over an encrypted channel).
The host should not keep the list in clear (e.g., hashing).
This is not a MAC, I revealed all the numbers, but it is cheaper as it is only paper(Problem of collection of coupons/figurines). If not abused it can be useful, pretty much impossible extract information digitally.
## Modern Technology: TOTP
Software that implements the same functionality of password generators. Use an app to generate tokens, 
Software that implements the same functionality of password generators:
 Key difference
- password generators are closed, embedded systems.
- password-generation apps work on general-purpose sw/hw platforms.
Counters don't use time but TOTP use times to compute the MAC. This is done by transforming the time in an integer.

![](https://i.imgur.com/JN9vN8n.png)

This attack is done by trying to clone the card or impersonate the owner of the sim and ask the clerk of the ISP for a clone(this is no more a viable way to do this attack).
Could also intercept the SMS but this is obviously a crime, hard felony.
## Modern Technologies: Secure Keys
Similar to a key but they compute the token for you and authenticate you. All these devices have a capacity sensor that needs to see a finger to activate. These are extremely handly, do the entire profile, can login in every big technology account. Can contain multiple autentication.
# The "to be" Factor.
## The "to be" Factor: Biometric.
This is measuring people, difficult as the measurement are annoying.
User must prove that it has some specific characteristics.
**Advantages**:
- high level of security,
- requires no extra hardware to carry around.
**Disadvantages**                                 **Countermeasures**
 - Hard to deploy                              none
- probabilistic matching                   none
- invasive measurement                  none
- can be cloned                               none (see next slides)
- bio-characteristics change          re-measure often,
- privacy sensitivity                        secure the process,
- users with disabilities                  need alternate (weaker?)
 Problem is it based on things that can changes(hairstyle, beard, finger burnt) but also on immutable features(face shape, fingerprint) and no secret features
### Technology examples
Extract the characteristics (i.e., features) of:
- Fingerprints (http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fprint/)
- Face geometry(https://code.google.com/p/pam-face-authentication/)
- Hand geometry (palm print)
- Retina scan
- Iris scan
- Voice analysis
- DNA
- Typing dynamics (http://flyer.sis.smu.edu.sg/ndss13-tey.pdf)
#### Example: Fingerprint
Enrollment: reference sample of the user’s fingerprint is acquired at a fingerprint reader.
Features are derived from the sample.
- Fingerprint minutiae: end points of ridges, bifurcation points, core, delta, loops, whorls, ?
- For higher accuracy, record features for more than one finger and different positions.
Feature vectors are stored in a secure database. When the user logs on, a new reading of the fingerprint is taken; features are compared against (similarity) the
reference features. User is accepted if match is above a predefined threshold.
**Main issue: false positives and false negatives**
The filters on the fingerprint needs to be the right amount otherwise you can have no difference on the fingers of two people.
You can bypass them with gummy bear as they have the same amount of water of a finger(take the fingerprint with scotch, use a PCB to obtain the negative of the fingerprint, produce the negative in copper and melt a gummy bear in the copper template to obtain your fingerprint). Need to check that the finger is alive to be gummy bear proof.
#### The "social" Factor: Who you know.
Alice must prove that she knows someone.
DO NOT USE PUBLIC INFORMATION TO AUTHENTICATE, using a public database of images to authenticate is not a good idea.
## Single Sign On
Problem: managing and remembering multiple passwords is complex.
- Users re-use passwords over multiple sites,
- Password policies replicated ($\$\$\$$).
Solution: 1 identity, 1-2 auth. factors, 1 trusted host.
- elect a trusted host,
- users authenticate (sign on) on the trusted host,
- other hosts ask the trusted host if a user is authenticated.
### Example: Shibboleth1. I am "John G. Student"
![](https://i.imgur.com/utjFaT4.png)

This method doesn't disseminate around information as AunicaLogin only transmit the fact that you have a live connection with it and not the password. 
Identity povider knows where you are going(its their job) and probably what you are going to do. Ideas is to have your own identity provider(can be done through libraries, pay attention to the age of the liibrary).
### Single Sign On: challenges
Single point of trust: the trusted server.
- If compromised, all sites are compromised.
- Password reset scheme must be bulletproof.
	- Email is the trusted element
Difficult to get right for the developers.
- The flow is complex to implement.
- Libraries exist, but they can be bugged.
## Password Managers
These are programs that locally encrypts your passwords with a master password, usually you have a multi-password authentication to access to the keys.
Can also have device manager password.
**Pros**: no need to remember all the passwords, it allows to generate robust passwords different for each service, can auto fill some logins(attention on the page you are letting auto-field to), can auto-synch(some are idiotic)
## Passkeys
Authentication without a password: ask for something you are or a token. Similar to a single factor authentication but uses a more robust stratagem. On the device there is a store for private keys that is symmetrically encrypted. The secure stored for biometric is using separated chips not binded to the OS. TO enroll to a service the device create a private key and then send the public key to the service.
Then for each login the service generate a challenge that the device resolve and authenticate the login.
Good passkey will periodically clean the password and ask to re-enter it. The best way is to unlock every time and erase the password and the required private key before sending the signature.
