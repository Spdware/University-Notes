**Identification:** put a label on something/someone. Usually is the login part.
**Authentication:** make sure that the label assigned to something/someone is correctly assigned. Need a proof to verify the identity.
Authentication can be unidirectional or bidirectional(mutual, you don't know if the server is the one you want to talk to).

Can happen between any entity:
- Human to human
- Human to computer
- Computer to computer
Foundation for the subsequent authorization phase
The bidirectional authentication may not be wanted, for example in google researches you may want to not be known to the servers(anonymous/pseudonymous authentication).
Firmware updates done properly does mutual authentication.
## Three Factors of Authentication
Something that the entity **knows** (to know)
1. Example: password, PIN, secret handshake.
Something that the entity **has** (to have)
2. Example: Door key, smart card, token.
Something that the entity **is** (to be)
3. Example: Face, voice, fingerprints.
Humans: (3) more used than (2), more used than (1).
Machines: (1) more used than (2), more used than (3).
Multi-factor authentication uses two or three factors. These are done to have more security and doing so having humanly separated factors(having the number where the security message is on the same phone the site you are trying to access is loosing the purpose of the multifactor authentication).
# The "to know" Factor
## Password
**Advantages**
- Low cost,
- ease of deployment,
- low technical barrier.
**Disadvantages**
Secrets can be
- stolen/snooped
- guessed(use the fact that the passwords aren't uniformly chosen)
- cracked (enumerated)
The last two disadvantages are the same only changes the way they are executed.
**Countermeasures** (i.e., costs)
Enforce passwords that
-  change/expire frequently
- are long and have a rich character set(in reality this doesn't do anything on the hardness of the guessing)
-  are not related to the user

## Why are Countermeasures Costs?
Humans are not machines
- Inherently unable to keep secrets, they are immaterial
- Hard to remember complex passwords
- Canâ€™t pick unlimited countermeasures
	 how to choose?

## User Education and Password Complexity
User education: "human" == "weak link".
- enforce strong passwords in the process.
- enforce password expiration/change policies
- use password meters to balance usability.
Password complexity
- must h4v3 4 r1ch, ch4r4ct3r, s3t!
- mUsT hAvE a MiXeD cAsE
- muuuuuuust beeeeeeeee loooooooong enoooooough

Should not cap the length of the password as you are limiting the pool of passwords. 
## Secure Password Exchange
Authentication is about sharing a secret.
How to minimize the risk that secrets get stolen?
- use mutual authentication if possible
- use a **challenge-response** scheme
	 use random data to avoid replay attacks

Number of problems:
- Authenticate on a remote server and not your pc. The communication can be spoofed and the attacker can impersonate you. You cannot put in the clear username and password(this was done in the 70s as the remote communication was done via dedicated cables inside buildings).
## Secure Password Storage
OS stores a file with usernames and passwords.
An attacker could try to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of this password file
How to minimize the risk that secrets get stolen?
- Cryptographic protection
	- Never store passwords in clear (hashing + salting to mitigate dictionary attacks)
- Access control policies (privileges to w/r)
- Never disclose secrets in password-recovery schemes.
Caching problem (information is held in intermediate storage locations)
If there is a proxy for the station you need to delete your traces after you are done(pay attention as Windows sysadmin).
# The "to have" Factor
User must prove that it possesses something.
**Advantages**
- Human factor (less likely to hand out a key),
- relatively low cost,
- good level of security.
**Disadvantages**
- Hard to deploy,
- can be lost or stolen.
**Countermeasures**
- none
- use with second factor.
Example of password manager is KeyPass(is local), BItWarden
A password manager SHOULDN'T send the master password through internet and use it on disk/master memory. The master password have to be stored on disk **NEVER**. Never cache the password master.
