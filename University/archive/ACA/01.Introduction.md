### Traditional" Computation
Software is written for serial computation
- It has to be executed on a single computer having a single Central Processing Unit (CPU)
- A problem is broken into a discrete series of instructions
- Instructions are executed one after another
- Only one instruction may execute at any moment in time

### SISD
A serial (non-parallel) computer
Single instruction: only one instruction stream is being acted on by the CPU during any one clock cycle
Single data: only one data stream is being used as input during any one clock cycle
Deterministic execution
This is the oldest and even today, the most common type of computer
### SIMD
A type of parallel computer
Single instruction: all processing units execute the same instruction at any given clock cycle
Multiple data: each processing unit can operate on a different data element
Best suited for specialized problems characterized by a high degree of regularity, such as graphics/image processing

#### Hardware parallelism
- Instruction-Level Parallelism: Exploits data-level parallelism at modest level through compiler techniques such as pipelining and at medium levels using speculation
- Vector architectures and Graphic Processor Units: Exploit data-level parallelism by applying a single instruction to a collection of data in parallel
- Thread-level parallelism: Exploits either data-level parallelism or task-level parallelism in a tightly coupled hw model that allows interaction among threads 
- Request-level parallelism: Exploits parallelism among largely decoupled tasks specified by the programmer or the OS
### MIMD
Nowadays, the most common type of parallel computer
Multiple Instruction: every processor may be executing a different instruction stream
Multiple Data: every processor may be working with a different data stream
Execution can be synchronous or asynchronous, deterministic or non-deterministic
