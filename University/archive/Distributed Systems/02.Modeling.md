# The software architecture of a distributed system

It can be Network OS based: the network OS provides the communication services, different machines may have different Network OSes, masking platform differences is up to the application 
programmer. You have to link all the operational services, the networking services.

Middleware based: the middleware provides advanced communication, coordination and administration services. It mask most of the platform differences.
Nowadays we use middleware in every system using it at a different degree.
### Middleware: A functional view
Middleware provides “business-unaware” services through a standard API, which raises the level of the communication activities of applications. 
Usually it provides:
- Communication and coordination services
	-  Synchronous and asynchronous
	- Point-to-point(TCP/IP) or multicast(UDP multicast)
	- Masking differences in the network OS
- Special application services 
	- Distributed transaction management, groupware and workflow services, messaging services, notification services, ...
- Management services
	- Naming, secutiry, failure handling, ...
# The run-time (system) architecture of a distributed system
It describe how the computation is splited on the different machines. The idea is the difference is in the easyness of the distribution in the application. 
Identifies the classes of components that build the system, the various types of connectors, and the data types exchanged at run-time
Modern distributed systems often adopt one among a small set of well known architectural styles
- Client-server
- Service Oriented
- REST
- Peer-to-peer
- Object-oriented
- Data-centered
- Event-based
- Mobile code
These models differentiate the different applications and there are difference also among them but they have the common base between all the class.
### Client-Server
Components have different roles:
- Server: provide a set of service through a well defined API(They are passive)
- Users access those services through clients
Communication is message based (or RPC)
**Tiers**
Often servers operate by taking advantage of the services offered by other distributed components
In such case we have a three-tiered client-server architecture
The services offered by a distributed application can be partitioned in three classes: User interface services, application services, storage services
Multi-tiered client-server applications can be classified looking at the way such services are assigned to the different tiers
__Two Tiered Architecture__
A machine run the client and a machine run the server.  The application layer are suddivided between the two machines depending on the needs of the application

__Three Tiered Architecture__
There are multiple machine where the layers of the application are run.
