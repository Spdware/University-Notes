## A definition of social media
Social media are Web 2.0 sites, i.e. sites that support any form of sharing of user-generated content by leveraging the social relationships among individuals. The extent to which social media leverage social relationships can vary from pure sharing of interests (e.g. YouTube channel) to a form of interaction among actual friends (e.g. Facebook).
In recent time there is also LLMs. Social media is a big innovation as it becomes a new way to communicate. 
## A wave of social change
There is contamination between real-life social relationships and the networks of
relationships on social media:
- social media create new social relationships (e.g. indirect contacts through Linkedyn)
- social media change existing relationships (e.g. dropping a fiancé by changing status on Facebook)
- social media change the time frame of social relations (e.g. keeping track of past work relationships with Linkedyn connections)
- social media reduce the barriers of knowledge sharing (e.g. Slide share) and, thus, reduce the klout of knowledge holders
- overall, social media make social relationships easier, reduce the importance of knowledge holders and increase the importance of content
Social media can influence the real world. You can now know people that you do not know in real life. Linkedin for example enable the connection with people you have done interesting works and enables a "log" of your works to let the other person remember that they worked with you and on what.
Can have different type of relationships: friends, work related, acquaintance etc...
Social functionalities can either be free or paid, the difference is based on the span and the scope of the functionality.
Social media also tries to lower the barrier of shared knowledge. Also nowadays with a book you receive also a lot of extra material with the intent to limit your searches through social media for material. LLM gives out a decent average of the subject, this is good if you have no knowledge on the argument.
If the content is high value added is protected from other people and LLM training, you cannot find everything publicly available. Expect to find a decent average on social media/internet(usually this can help you to achieve a good work/gain knowledge for the job you need to do).
Long term forecast are difficult to make, easier to look back and see if there are recurring events that can help for our predictions. 
If you do not embrace changes you can be in a lot of trouble as you are protecting/using material that is not adequate enough/is partial. 
## Content vs. content holders
Since clout on social media depends very much on content, social media tend to care about the quality of content and invest in keeping it clean and dependable (e.g. wikipedia).
In general, if something is on social media, we take it as «true». In general, the source is not considered enough to guarantee that content is true. People trust social media content thanks to the «wisdom of the crowds». If something is not true, somebody would know it and tell the community.
Some knowledge is worthy of protection as it is still true and good. The problem with social media is that there can be fake knowledge around, even in emergency. 
You can hear the opposite information from two different users, so we need dependable and accountable sources to gain information from. 
## Classes of social media
1. Content sharing (videos(e.g. Youtube, Vimeo), pictures (e.g. Flickr), music (e.g. Napster) , knowledge (e.g. GoogleDocs, OS), experience (e.g. Yelp, or any feedback system))
2. Social networks (e.g. Facebook, Orkut ...)
3. Forums (moderated interactions, netiquette, evolution of bulletin boards and newsgroups, e.g. 4chan.org). Forum didn't desappear but they changed their way of fruition as they are a good way to exchange information
4. Blogs (personal blogs, corporate blogs, news blogs, political blogs, prison blogs...). Platforms: blogspot, wordpress
## The crowdsourcing paradigm
Wikipedia – «Crowdsourcing is the act of sourcing tasks traditionally performed by specific individuals to a group of people or community (crowd) through an open call.» Crowdsourcing is a distributed problem-solving and production model.
Why is crowdsourcing powerful? Because of the wisdom of the crowd.
We can exploiting the fact that some people find fun to contribute in the diffusion of  information to let them do it for free.

Engagement is a keyword as it is needed to be taken in consideration to have a better reach.
### The wisdom of the crowd
Wikipedia – **The wisdom of the crowd** refers to the process of taking into account the collective opinion of a group of individuals rather than a single expert to answer a question.
Historical case:
The classic wisdom-of-the-crowds finding involves point estimation of a continuous  quantity. At a 1906 country fair in Plymouth, eight hundred people participated in a contest to estimate the weight of a slaughtered and dressed ox. Statistician Francis Galton observed that the mean of all eight hundred guesses, at 1197 pounds, was closer than any of the individual guesses to the true weight of 1198 pounds. This has contributed to the insight in cognitive science that a crowd’s individual judgments can be modeled as a probability distribution of responses with the mean centered near the true mean of the quantity to be estimated.
You can extract the common leaf of social media to gain a good knowledge that can be better than the one of the experts taken one at a time. The non experts need to have a little knowledge on the arguments we are talking about to let the wisdom of the crowd works. No collective knowledge, you need some training to be part of the crowd.
## Co-creation – definition
Co-creation is a product/service innovation paradigm based on the cooperation between a supplier and the potential customers of the new product/service.
Cooperation can be:
- Direct, i.e. customer participation in the innovation process is deliberate (aware) and active.
- Indirect: innovation occurs by taking advantage of the suggestions, comments, and opinions that customers provide in a variety of ways (call center, corporate site, social media...) without making them explicitly part of the innovation process (and related decision-making tasks).
Working with a non cooperating client is difficult as they have unreasonable expectations and gives little feedbacks.
Giving credits helps in maintaining retention/helps as reward as they can be used to get a better/another job. The system should be designed to recognize the efforts of the users that give useful inputs. 
Social media is unmanageable as people can talk freely and exchange opinions whenever they want(so it is difficult to control).
Need to be creative and fast as you may need to relate advertisement campaigns to some events and you cannot let these opportunities to slip from your hands.
### Co-creation and «listening»
- On social media, customers spontaneously provide suggestions, comments, and opinions.
- Listening can provide indications on all the inputs provided by customers that can be useful for product/service innovation.
- Listening is important in both types of co-creation, direct and indirect.
Companies should try to listen outside their communities to understand the real market opinions and not the ones that belong to already loyal customers. This helps to understand their strength and weaknesses. Only problem is that the social media employer is also responsible of the press image of the company so there is a conflict of interests as the employer could try to resolve the negativity they found or they can hide these negativity as they can hinder their job. Worst case is when you delegate these job to a consultant agency.
### Direct and indirect co-creation
There exist success stories of both types of co-creation.
Usually, indirect co-creation represents the first step (according the the «listen first» principle)
A broad-range listening, outside of one’s own community can help identify a few indirect co-creation initiatives useful to set clear goals for direct co-creation.

## Co-creation and crowdsourcing
Co-creation can be effective by leveraging crowdsourcing.
There exist successful companies entirely based on co-creation and crowdsourcing.
When co-creation is aimed at design, it can focus on «influencers»
Example:
Nyden, a new H&M brand, engages with hand-picked “tribe leaders,” to “co-create” the clothing range. He comfirmed that the tattoo artist Doctor Woo, who has 1.3 million Instagram followers, as well as the Swedish actress, Noomi Rapace are already on board to work on the new line (Source: Fashionunited).

Influencers are content creators with a big loyal audience. Companies tries to engage these influencers giving them recognition, inviting to events or giving products for free to try to use their channels for advertisement. Usually the people that interact with the influencers are social media people and will not forgive easily when you lie. So the problem that arise from this situation is that the followers can vanish really easily if you misbehave/tries to change your brand and do not advertise product/behaviour related to their brand. So advertisement is done carefully to not damage their image.
### Main risk of co-creation initiatives
A fundamental risk of co-creation initiatives is to assume that customers will be  happy to cooperate and will contribute to the initiative just because they are provided a chance to do so. Contribution should be encouraged and coordinated with a careful design of co-creation initiatives.
Moderation can helps in limiting the trolling and false information spread in your initiative. 
### Main design variables of co-creation initiatives
Checklist:
- Participation mechanisms
- Technology platform
- Roles and tasks of community members
- Types of users in the community
- Incentive systems and rewards
- Quality control mechanisms
## The traditional marketing paradigm
Marketing is defined as «market orientation». It involves sensing market requirements to respond with organizational flexibility.
Traditionally, the first step of marketing was to make an organization’s products and services known to the market, as a necessary action to stimulate feedback. Unfortunately, this communication has been found to be very effective also to drive the market especially through broadcasting. As a consequence, traditional marketing is often equated to advertising and there is always the idea that you can both sense and drive the market.
Through advertising you can create needs that aren't there to begin with, you can create a market for your products or you can change the opinion on your product so much that the customer will buy it instead of the product of on of your competitor.
**Suspension of consciousness**: if the advertising is interesting enough you just watch the advertising and if the content is good enough you accept it even if they are lying to you. 
Usually you need to maintain a behaviour that let you have content discussion from below to up the line and not vice versa.
**Remember to ask the example of Intesa on this matter**
