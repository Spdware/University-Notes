## A definition of social media
Social media are Web 2.0 sites, i.e. sites that support any form of sharing of user-generated content by leveraging the social relationships among individuals. The extent to which social media leverage social relationships can vary from pure sharing of interests (e.g. YouTube channel) to a form of interaction among actual friends (e.g. Facebook).
In recent time there is also LLMs. Social media is a big innovation as it becomes a new way to communicate. 
## A wave of social change
There is contamination between real-life social relationships and the networks of
relationships on social media:
- social media create new social relationships (e.g. indirect contacts through Linkedyn)
- social media change existing relationships (e.g. dropping a fianc√© by changing status on Facebook)
- social media change the time frame of social relations (e.g. keeping track of past work relationships with Linkedyn connections)
- social media reduce the barriers of knowledge sharing (e.g. Slide share) and, thus, reduce the klout of knowledge holders
- overall, social media make social relationships easier, reduce the importance of knowledge holders and increase the importance of content
Social media can influence the real world. You can now know people that you do not know in real life. Linkedin for example enable the connection with people you have done interesting works and enables a "log" of your works to let the other person remember that they worked with you and on what.
