Industry 4.0 means also how we integrate the new technologies to the industry and our lives, blur the line between physical and logical world. it is something visionary and talk about technologies that don't exist yet.
Predictive maintenance tries to maximise efficiency of the system prolonging the operational life cycle of a system and tries to minimize the down state of the system. Down moment are also the moments where you are doing something on the plant and it cannot produce(pay attention to the trade-off between maintenance and production loss). External disabled state is when you are doing maintenance as the system is not the one that broke down.
Using predictive maintenance you can predict when an item in the system break down and schedule maintenance. To do so you need data acquisition on the state of the system and to get the data you need to monitor the degradation continuously. To get the data in electronic format only and get the equipment with the right sensors. This means a significant investment in new competence and machines, usually done incrementally and replacing the production line a bit at a time to introduce the new machine to be able to do predictive maintenance. Usually the first thing you do is a data science pilot to duty the manifacturing as it applies a very traditional mentality, you do not need to reinvent the system to test the market, you need to make your production system more efficient. Benefits are there and only need to exploit them.
