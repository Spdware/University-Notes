# What are Web Information Systems (WIS)?
Definition of WIS as a system where:
1. The communication among machines (servers and clients) uses the public Internet or an IP-based private VPN
2. Users access functionalities throgh a browser
It represents a very broad definition including both sites and portals, as well as traditional information systems (core ERPs) redesigned to provide their functionalities
through the Internet with a browser-based interface.
LLM creates difficulties in integration with business, but they will remain only because they are really useful data wise. 
Problem: when you want to implement a client side application at first is bound to fail, then when the SW mature the issues decreases. You have to deal with all the issues one as a time as they related to PC, SW, etc...
Usually not a good idea to use a client idea as it requires money to develop and to resolve all the related issues. Browsers "eliminate" this problem as there is only a few of them and, nowadays, there are strong framework to work with. Interface need to be simple to make the framework responsive. Also browsers are important as they changed the paradigm: no client side logic, only server side the client only take care of visualization. This let small devices to run access the application. If the application is heavy the provider will require you to install a client to oblige you to use your resources.  
Engineer approach is not visionary as they focus on making things work now with now technologies and not think about 10 years after.
Companies can use Fleet Manager to create the environment on the desktop computer in the company, but this only work on site if they are sick/cannot be in office they don't have the resources to work. Browsers enable the flexibility to work from everywhere.
Connecting and connecting easily are two different things: easy connection is something that helps a lot. 
## Innovation with WIS
The Internet is a network that has brought connectivity to individuals → companies are connected with their retail customers
Nov. 2000 stock exchange failure (dot com bubble)
The Web is a window on a company’s processes (and their performance)
The quality of Web sites and portals cannot be high if companies have not completed the integration of their information processes (common unified data, consistent omni-channel processes)
The Web is the enabling technology of customer relationship management (CRM) and allows the omni-channel integration of service distribution
As omni-channel integration is deployed, the Web becomes the single access point for both customers and internal users
Vision helps technologies to rapidly adapt to new technologies. 
Can also use virtual agency to reach someone. Geographical presence is no longer a must/no longer needed/alternative approach as you can have multiple clients distributed on the planet that you can reach instantly. But if you already have agency around the world what happens? Are you going to be replaced by virtual agency? The answer is difficult, but trend to access services through web services is still increasing. The penetration is different between the services. For example grocery shopping for fresh products is still done mainly in presence.
Having legacy can be an hindrance as there could be something that cannot be adapted to new channels. Someone can think to open new agency/location to not have legacy to permit an easily adaptation. For example there is banks that totally dematerialyze their agency and tried to have everything online(really need a lot of time to emerge). Nowadays also companies need to be able to prove they can produce earnings and not doing them to have investment in the stock market. Volatility as there is only investment and not real money in the making.
## eCommerce – definition
eCommerce is the activity of buying or selling of products (goods or services) on online services (ref. Wikipedia).
Most eCommerce services are on the Web.
The term eCommerce usually refers to retail customers.
The term eBusiness is used to refer to business customers.
The term eGovernment is used to refer to services offered by public institutions to citizens.
On web there is an incorrect approach that if you have the best product you can sell really well on the web, as you can have access to much more possible customer than the ones you can reach locally. 
On the Web you have to be VIsible/acquire VIsibility as it is necessary to emerge from the crowd. 
Also with Web Shops the company need to make sure they handle logistics about the product reaching the customer/activities done by costumers before. The price necessary is different between in presence and web shopping as web shopping requires more actions done by the costumer. 
### The starting point of eCommerce projects
eCommerce sites have been often implemented by separate teams, often involved in rebranding initiatives (e.g. Bank24 - Deutsche Bank)
The design of eCommerce sites involves a variety of competences (typically, IT + design + product innovation + marketing)
The management of eCommerce sites involves new competences, in particular editors creating and updating content
The Web is a distribution channel, a production technology, and a source of external information → it involves revolutionary change
## Company sites: information services

Presentation of company
- Mission and objectives
- Organization structure
- Balance sheet
- Press reports
- News and events
- Work with us
Product information:
- (Product catalog in pdf)
- Multimedia online catalog
• Contacts:
- Call center
- Company sites, agencies, etc.
- Map
A website is like the window of a shop, it needs to contain the information of the company, the catalogue of the company and contacts.
Amazon is really good in the mass market, for quality things people still wants to go in person to assure the quality.
### Company portal, eCommerce, organizational structure
Issues:
- Design a navigation structure for information and online services
- Retrieve information
- Constantly update information
Solutions
- Federation: one central site with general information and services and multiple local sites serving different organizational units that are locally managed (e.g. university/departments)
- Editorial committee: it should be created at the beginning of the WIS project and it becomes a permanent organizational unit
- Help desk: the call center and the Web should be tightly integrated.
Information can be distributed and difficult to reach. Cost of an editor that goes around, catch information and then changes the website. 
### Quality criteria of an eCommerce site

**Content**– It represents the quality of the information and services provided by the site. It depends on:
- Completeness
- Dependability, i.e. user ability of assessing the correctness of information
**Structure**– It describes the quality of the structure of content and depends on:
- Centralized vs. federated, if federated different organizational units provide diverse information with no standard (quality is lower, but it is cheaper)
- Understandability, i.e. users’ ability to build a conceptual model of the site that supports easy retrieval of information and easy interpretation/use.
Presentation– It describes the quality of the Web interface and depends on:
- Graphics, i.e. appeal and visualization tools.
- Coherence of graphic style
- Page layout, i.e. position of information and links
**Navigation**:
- paths
- intuitiveness
- reference points (e.g. «home» or «back»)
- Interaction (amount of cross-links)
Need to have the important information updated frequently/be precise and don't want to make customers confused as this will hinder the sellings.
Also comfort in having similar website design as it helps the customers to find information easily and let them buy your product easily.
You don't want to have dead ends as they hinder your capacity to retain customers.
## Search engines
Google, Bing, Yahoo!
Differences: total number of Web pages in the directory of the search engine
(between 1 and 3 billion pages).
60% to 90% of Web pages is not considered by search engines
Ranking of results based on term similarity Pay for ranking (Google adwords)
Google can decide who is the one that is reached by web searches.
Target advertising on the web is more difficult as it needs to calculate the click for dollar ratio as there is no desired hours where to put your advertisement to be more efficient.
## Marketplaces
They sell products and services from multiple companies, e.g.:
- Geographical brands (e.g. «Franciacorta» or «Ticino»)
- Users’ needs (aggregators, e.g. Yoox).
Companies should share order management and delivery processes.
Common within districts for SMEs.
Standard in mobile app market (App store, Play store).
Yoox is a well known aggregator for fashion as it understand the dynamics of fashion selling. Tries to promote local brands as they can help in not spending too much time on search engines.
## Online auctions
**Ascending** (or English) auction. The vendor sets a minimum price. The product is sold to the last highest offer (with timeout). The price only goes up(dynamic marketing). Example of applying is art(need to convince the market that the resource is scarce and/or rare).
**Descending** (or Dutch) auction: The vendor sets a maximum price that is decreased by a fixed amount at regular time intervals down to a minimum price. The product is sold to the first client offering to buy at the current price.
**Vickrey auction**: all customers make an undisclosed offer within a given time frame. The product is sold to the second highest offer.
When customer can choose based on fixed price we are in ideal market as customer trust that the price coincide with quality.
