# INTRODUCTION TO MARKETING AND BASIC PROCESSES

Try to explore the market and understanding the trends and the customers and understand how the company is positioned in it. Need to put the customer at the centre to satisfy their needs and it needs to produce a profit/value for the company.

## MARKETING COMMUNICATION DEFINITION
The means by which firms attempt to inform, persuade and remind customers – directly or indirectly – about the products or brands that
they sell» Philip Kotler
Use new technologies to communicate with the customers to deliver new products or innovations and to cater to the customers needs.
The communication also include the persuasion and reminding to the customer that our products are good and we remind them that we exist.
## INTEGRATED COMMUNICATION

- Planned communication: communicate the product characteristics
- Product-Service communication: communicate the characteristic of the product through the only name of the brand/product
- Indirect Communication: satisfied customers will suggest to people they talk to to buy your product, so we need to use this influencing factor
All these methods are uniform and communicate the same message. Need to not confuse the customer.
## COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES

The Hierarchical Answer Models is the traditional model, but nowadays it is becoming less effective and needs to be changed
The customer response stage is a new model where the customer, bombarded with information, tries to understand what is going on, then you want to try to influence them to buy your products.
Even if I am advertising something I need to move the channels of advertising to emotional stages.
## NEW EVERYDAY BEHAVIOURS

These types of changes in different models, for example the 4M.
An example can be multiscreen(looking at multiple things at the same time), multitasking(doing multiple actions at the same time), multichannel(use different channels for the same action) and mobile(using mobile devices).
So we need a new model as the linear one is no more useful.
SINCE CHANGES IN CUSTOMERS’ BEHAVIOURS, THE  TRADITIONAL  MARKETING
 FUNNEL DOESN’T EXIST ANYMORE.

Each customer has their own journey.

The most important aspect is the fact that the final stages can be as important as the initial stages of the funnel(different from the traditional channel)
Individuals seek reassurance, gather information, discuss, and explore multiple topics. That is why Kotler identified 5 “A”s which follows the customer through its journey, in a “bowtie funnel”.

Customer advocate: can be a god or bad as they can talk about the product in a good or bad way. If I am encouraging/treating good the customer in the left part of the funnel we can have a positive behaviour in the right part.
If we want to convey an effective communication it needs to be integrated. Each channel need the right information to work as flawlessly as possible

# THE BATTLE FOR ATTENTION IN THE AGE OF DISTRACTION
## SO, HOW TO BE RELEVANT?
![](https://i.imgur.com/ZPA1Fat.png)

Today for everyone that tries to communicate there is a battle for attention. The point is how can I be relevant as customer have poor attention and are not expecting me. The communication needs to be in the intersection as there reside the best possibility to be heard from the customer.
You need the right comment to gain the attention of the customer, you need to communicate at the right moment as if the customer is concentrated to a different type of activity they will not listen to you. Also need the right channel to not talk to no one. Also need to talk to the right audience, the one that could be interested in your product.

## THE THREE STRATEGIC PILLARS OF THE NEW MARKETING PARADIGM
Strategic multichannel marketing is based on:
- Co-Creation: customers are more opens to communicate with the brand and to "helps" in the creation of a product(in some cases).
- Multichannel: having multiple channels and integrating them 
- Branded Experience: nowadays you not buy only the product but also the experience that derive from it. Every moment should be curated to be the best for the situation
## THE KEY INGREDIENTS FOR A REAL MULTICHANNEL APPROACH

The combination of all these pieces is the only way to deliver a seamless experience to the customer. 
Changing the relationship with the customers doesn’t mean to just add channels to the channel mix, but radically and deeply modify the business model offering a new and richer value experience.
### IT CHANGES THE WAY OF THINKING
The Customer is in the center of the strategy
The company has to pay attention to his/her characteristics in order to satisfy his/her needs and give him/her a unique experience
That’s why we talk about CUSTOMER OBSESSION: having the customer in your mind at each moment when you are creating your strategy/product
### AND THE WAY OF ACTING
The relationship with the customer has to happen throughout different
touchpoints that communicate with each other, giving customized
messages in order to get a more efficient relationship. It’s necessary to create an INTEGRATED MULTICHANNEL ECOSYSTEM
## MARKETERS TODAY HAVE ACCESS TO A WIDE ARRAY OF OMNICHANNEL LEVERS: ONLINE & OFFLINE
![](https://i.imgur.com/nPNtlmF.png)

- Paid Media: media the company is paying, example is google ads/ads
- Owned Media: the media owned by the company(ex: emails)
- Earned Media: media the company can generate/influence but not control(ex: influencer that talks about our brand but is not a paid sponsorship)
Usually the paid media is used to reach a greater plateau of customers.
**Data is the new oil**
Owned media are crucial because they don’t just allow you to publish content — they enable you to capture and control first-party data.
By using owned platforms, companies keep data in-house,unlocking strategic advantages in personalization, privacy compliance, and performance measurement.
First party data have to be stored somewhere and need to be extracted as they are needed to know the customer and communicate effectively with them. So this type of data is stored in the company own storage and not delegated to someone else. 
Thus how well a company uses these channels depends not only on what tools it owns, but also on how mature it is in collecting, integrating, and activating data.That’s why Google and BCG developed the Digital Maturity Model – to assess how far a company is in its digital transformation journey.
## The digital Maturity Model

## WHY DIGITAL MATURITY MATTERS?
Companies advancing in digital maturity often gain significant competitive advantages, hereafter some examples of benefits:
- FOSTER REVENUE GROWTH: digitally mature organizations show significantly higher revenue growth than less mature ones. This because you have customer more emotional involved in your brand, you can better integrate the data in your processes
- INCREASE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY: automation and data integration reduce operational costs and improve marketing efficiency. This reduce the time needed to operate these systems. You do not loose time in the compacting/handling of the data.
