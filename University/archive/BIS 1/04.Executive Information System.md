At executive level you NEED the data to find answers to your managerial question and to planning the next steps.

At strategic level managers decide what they want to do, which client listen to. There is a production clumps. They are always based on sales/demands predictions/projections(Variables are aggregate margins/markets). They make high level plans based on aggregation information.
Management control has to manage the resources to enable the plans of the strategic level. Their main resources is budget, they manage financial information and costs(It is all about budget managing).
At Operational control level manager plans what the production is going to do(What to produce for what market).
They operate on various dashboards as they are implemented for different business/market.
Information is created at operational level in a structured electronic format natively to help analysis in a dashboard. If it is not in a structured electronic nature there is a need to transform it to not loose it. You need people that create the data entry/information in electronic format. This is feasible BUT it is not economically acceptable. Also data entry is error prone. Decision has to be made on facts and information and not following feelings and guts(You should look at the data but not get overloaded from the data).

Company always have new products and new markets. You need to do the difficult job of predicting if a project is successful (You will do a market test). There is times where companies are "milking their cows" and only invest in their successful product and not innovate. A way to do innovation is through money(Finance startups and then buy out the successful ones). You have to aggregate information to support a multi-dimension analysis.

Different types of information. For each instances there are different types of information. You have to pay attention to critical success factor to individuate the critical information in your dataset.

### Design a Dashboard

A dashboard will always evolve to stay on par with the new technologies. 
You usually have to use and adapt to something someone else has done. Simplicity is the keyword, manager make decisions on the outcome of the dashboard so complex analytics have to be made simple. The query don't have to be made directly to the operational database because they are time expensive and occupy all the database capacity. The transaction is immediate and requires query and database processes so it is needed to separate them. We use the night to do query as the transaction are done usually/in the most part in during date time. This type of query are called ETL(Extraction Translate Loading, query are done on yesterday data).
Key Performance Indicators(KPI), i.e. aggregate information providing a summary evaluation of a set of production activities or performance parameters. Indicators have a value defined by different dimensions, including:
- Time (extension and granularity)
- Organizational unit
- Customer
- Product
- Process and activity
- Other dimensions such as channel, geographical area, projectâ€¦
KPI are used to measure the performance of a product. They comprehend indicators of performance, they are measurable, they have a units, names, labels, tags. The tags are needed to give a meaning to the indicator. You store the higher level of details/lower level of abstraction of the indicator in the data warehouse. There can be multiple tables in a data warehouse. The points is denormalize to avoid joins so you speedup the execution time. Managers want to scan all the database and have an answer in  millisecond time. This is not feasible if you don't put a lot of limitations.  
### Design steps of executive information systems
- Business requirements (key performance indicators)
- Information sources
- Information transformation
- Information storage
	- Table of facts
	- Table of keys
	- Data warehouse design
- Processing level
	- Presentation and reporting
	- Decision support engines
	- Visualization engines
	- Knowledge extraction engines
Now we need to design a dashboard. Having quasi real time queries. You need to understand information sources, you have to build your tables. A table of keys help to maintain a hierarchy and to build queries automatically. Need one table of keys per dimension. Need to find an aggregate index that tells me how the product is doing in the market. You want to make simulation modifying the weights in the constrains. These way of operating can lead to sub-optimal decision. 
A data mart is a materialization of a smaller database used for a specific needs or they are not materialized but handles a small number of users.
