### Nature of task: manufacturing vs. service companies
ERP(package software that companies can take and personalise to support manager). 
ERP systems have vertical solutions tailored to the needs of specific industries.  Vertical solutions are usually fine grained. The coarse grained distinction is made between manufacturing and service companies. There are framework for solution that are shared between industries(The ideal standard client doesn't exist). 
Distinction between manufacturing and services: a manufacturing company has operation/production processes on tangible/physical goods, a service company takes information as an input and produces information as an output(intangible).  
ERP was invented first for manufacturing companies and then it was translated to service companies.
#### IT portfolio in manufacturing companies

Portfolio typically refers to finance. 
1. Administrative portfolio: It automates administrative and bureaucratic organizational activities, it handles the finance of the company, keeps track of the money flow, knows when is the best time to hire a new employee, manage company bank accounts, etc... Administrator Finance is the function that handles the finance of the company, handles the stocks of the company. IT was considered a portfolio application. It is almost always industry independent, it is country-specific, it represents the first step of automation as it involves number crunching, it involves limited decision making while it is procedural and repetitive, it is traditionally considered stand-alone but it isn't(activity based costing), it can be functionally complex(example: balance sheet).     
2. Operational portfolio: application that support operation
3. Executive portfolio: applications that support managerial roles
These three functional areas have developed separately and are now integrated inside ERP systems. They constitute the core functionalities of ERP systems
### Manufacturing production processes and inter-functional information processes
#### Porter's concept of information intensity
1. Information intensity represents the size and complexity of the information used by the processes of an organization (minimal in cigar manufacturing, maximum in banks)
2. IT intensity is the actual ability of IT to satisfy the information processing requirements of organizational processes (it is greater in banking than it is in insurance)
3. Management inclination is the degree to which a company’s management considers IT as a strategic lever (it depends on a number of factors such as computer literacy, culture, company history, etc.).
4. In general, information intensity in greater in services than it is in manufacturing.
5. IT intensity can be greater in manufacturing than it is in services.
6. Historically, the management orientation towards IT was greater in manufacturing. Services have experienced a delay in IT development of about 10 years.
7. Degree to which information processing activities are structured and, thus, can be easily translated into a computing procedure (predetermined steps and decision tree).
8. Volumes, i.e. the amount of information to be processed.
9. Frequency with which a given operation is repeated
10. Computational complexity of operations, the simpler, the better.

- Inbound Logistics: all the logistic used to acquire all the primary resources to product your products
- Outbound logistics: logistic used to reach the customer
Forget the hierarchy and focus on what it is needed to do for success.
Processes are interfunctional.
### Manufacturing activity cycles
Iterative, Continuous
Important to think the production as a cycle to help developing the new infrastructures/IT/managerial choice in the right way.
1. Development cycle: It is in charge of designing and industrializing a) products and b) production processes
2. Logistic cycle: It is in charge of managing customers’ orders, with the following activities:
	1. Procurement: acquisition of materials, physical management of materials (internal logistic processes), such as reception, warehousing, dispatching to productions plants, etc.
	2. Production: physical transformation of materials
	3. Sales and Distribution: order management, external logistic processes, post-sale processes (maintenance, customer support, etc.). Logistic is complex and takes a lot of time and resources.
### Interfunctional information processes
1. Order management process: it manages the information regarding orders and activities associated to fullfill that order
2. Materials management process: manages information regards material about outgoing orders towards suppliers to usage in the transformation process
3. Operations management process: it manages the information regarding operations from materials dispatching to production plants to product delivery
Different products and different divisions involve ALL production processes and ALL interfunctional information processes $\rightarrow$ the information systems is tightly bound to organizational structure.
Different production cycles share information:
-  Information on stocks is created by the materials management and used by order management during sale activities
- Information on stocks is created by the materials management and used by production
- Information on orders is created during sales activities and used by production
- Information on orders is created during sales activities and used by internal logistic
1. Interfunctional information is used by the planning and control processes (or management processes). Examples are:
	- Strategic production planning (which products to produce for which markets)
	- Budget allocation
	- Scheduling and operations management
2. Interfunctional information is used by administrative activities. Examples are:
	- Cash flow management
	- Project management
An inner manager has to be efficient and effective as they have to coordinate other people and they have to know the various structures of the company teams/structures.
Need to take care of this aspect for application as the interface needs to take care of different task spanning the entire process(SILO approach isn't useful anymore).
Interfunctional means projecting your process taking in consideration all the parts of the process. This means that you are becoming less specialised and you are generalising. 

### Standard vs. Custom Production
- **Standard production**: products have a finite set of predetermined features that can be changed to accommodate customer preferences (e.g. colour, size, optionals, etc.). In this case, companies produce according to a sales plan, before actual orders are received. There can be some parts of the product that are customised as the customer wants but these new features will require times as the manufacturer is going to produce these last bits of process.
- **Custom production**: products are designed according to customer requirements and then produced on demand (if something is produced a corresponding order must exist).
Differences between these type of production, if fully standard customers cannot decide anything on the product, fully custom you can specify everything. Can be a mix of the two where one type is more predominant but there are some characteristics of the other. The customisation depends on the usage of the product.  
Observations:
- There is a continuum between standard and custom production.
- Intuitively, custom production is associated with complex artifacts, while standard production is associated with simple artifacts.
- Actually, the degree of standardization and the degree of complexity of products are independent variables and all combinations exist.
- Information technology (IT) applies to all combinations, but functionalities are substantially different.
If a market is not mature every product in the market has a great value, if there are already products of the same type your product has to be of an higher value to be considered. 
### Classes of operational information
Information stored in the DataBase:
1. Transaction information: it describes the flow of operational activities. 
2. Operations planning information: it describes the objectives and the expected results of operational activities. Seemingly static as the processes don't change so much overtime
3. Catalog information: it represents a basic knowledge that is independent of the flow of production activities. It is referred to as a static type of information (although it is not)
Concerned about changes in organisational settings, innovation is the thing that matter, companies don't buy the new product if they hadn't fully utilise the old one.
#### Transaction Information
Transaction information describes the flow of operational activities in terms of exchanges between responsibilities (or organizational units) and between internal responsibilities and external players. Examples are:
- Contracts with customers and suppliers
- Status of production activities
- Transfers of materials and half-finished goods between responsibilities.
- Certification of events, such as inclusion of a new product in the catalogue, the certification of a new supplier, etc
It is also used to store information between units, to get information for planning purposes. Helps also to register costs of operations.
Informations are added to the various rows to fullfill customer orders. In a company when you are done with your task you inform the system you are done with your task so the computer stores the information in the information database. This helps as triggers the next activities automatically/can inform to not act as the task isn't completed yet. It also stores important information on my activities, my efficiency and effectiveness(how long it takes to complete the task, the material I use) on the tasks(evaluating of my work without me writing a report, incentivizing people to compile the reports precisely, people have to want to compile the report, you have to spurt this behaviour with a positive approach).
