Enterprise Resource Planning (together with Customer Relationship Management) has involved a major change in the IT industry (starting from the mid â€˜90s), since:
-  It has represented a global phenomenon
- It has transformed the approach to computerization from coding to purchasing a package +. Consulting services
-  It has integrated all three portfolios:
	- Operational
	- Administrative
	- Executive
Planning and control are the main concern of manager. ERP helps them to elaborate plans and control everything. With the ERP the market and IT people started to recognize that companies in the same industry have a lot in common(Administrative and Executional) so it can be build a software that helps them all.  So the idea is to build a SW in a way that it has parameter representing a company and we do parametrization instead of recoding for every company. If the ERP is generalized it is easier to use and don't need a IT person always working on it. Need of low coding architecture.

A company well managed, competent in technologies and cooperative doesn't really need an ERP but a company which is the opposite can really take advantage of an ERP. If you are really good develop ad hoc, if not buy. 
THe Administrative portfolio is an example where everyone use an ERP.
