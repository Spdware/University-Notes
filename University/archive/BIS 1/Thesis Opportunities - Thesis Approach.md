The general rule is if you like something you should do a thesis on and choose an advisor you like/can work with fine.
For start you can start to talk to different advisor with not much commitment, search process with a lot of freedom
Need to be really fast as a thesis available correspond to a job to be done so the first student who ask and be accepted is the one to take the thesis(Take what there is for the point of time you are in)
The choice of thesis is not so life changing: be committed and work well but it is a 6 month experience so not so chancing
Make a short list(3/4 ) of professor
The good time to start a thesis depends on the credits left: between 30 and 20 credits left is a good time to start looking for a thesis, but when you have 40 credits could be a good time to start talking with professor about it
2 type of thesis:
- With coadvisor: more than 4 months of work and are more difficult, you are given a technical innovation problem and need to find a technical solution for it. It is a research thesis. You will have a trial and error approach. If you want the magna cum laude part in the degree you HAVE to do this type of thesis. Usually 90/100 pages long
- Without coadvisor: more or less 4 months of work full time, more simpler, you are given a problem, a technical solution for the problem and you have to apply it and do research on it. Usually 60/70 pages long
The lessons from thesis with coadvisor is the scientific method and how to publish a work in the scientific world. Recommended if you want to do research for a living. 
Thesis without coadvisor will give up to 4 points.Thesis with coadvisor will give up to 7 points. 
More easy to downgrade from thesis with coadvisor to thesis without coadvisor than that upgrade from thesis without coadvisor to thesis with coadvisor.
Stick to the graduation time you choose it is much better to get a lower grade but not delay things, be professional and move on in life.
The subject of the thesis can be choose between doing it in Politecnico and take a stage. To choose that you need to understand what you want to do. For thesis with coadvisor is best to search for a coadvisor and then find the research you will do. For a stage is not impossible to find an advisor, what can help is find a professor that is related to your stage. The advise is not do a stage if it is not paid(It should at least cover transportation and food expenses).
A stage thesis is not recommended if you have a lot of exams left as it is not nice to disappears when the exam session starts(it is not essential as it only anticipate the learning experience in working space)
