### Industry, customer, business users
Sector: refers to a large segment of the economy. It encompasses various related industries and companies. Sectors are broad classifications that group together businesses with similar characteristics or functions.
Industry: more specific group of companies that share common business activities or operate in a similar business sphere. Companies within the same industry offer similar products or services and compete for customers with specific needs.
These terms seem interchangeably but usually we compare companies sharing industries(and so they share the sector). They share the know-how, the customers, the regulations changes and the financial reporting.
#### Consumer Goods Sector
The consumer goods sector encompasses companies that produce final products intended for direct use by individuals and households. These products are purchased for personal enjoyment and consumption, rather than for further manufacturing or industrial purposes.
Its traits are the consumer behaviour(The performance of the consumer goods sector heavily depends on consumer behaviour. When the economy grows, demand for higher-end products increases. Conversely, during economic downturns, thereâ€™s a relative demand for value products. Correlation between Market consumer Behaviour and the sector), Advertising and Brand Differentiation: Many companies in this sector rely on advertising and brand differentiation. Developing new flavours, fashions, and styles and effectively marketing them to consumers is a priority, Technological Trends as modern internet technology has significantly impacted how products are manufactured,
distributed, marketed, and sold in the consumer goods sector.

If an industry is highly regulated you have to take good care of respect the law related to the industry.
#### How to analyse a player

We analyse the business structure of the player.
Usually we have a source of data internally at the company where we start the analysis. The next stage is depletion and is the stage where the distributor sells to his distributor to the public. The deplition data are bought from third party companies. The sell-out phase is when the customer buy the product.
The person we interact with is the Product Owner and are responsible of the selling strategy, gives access to his product to his business unit.

### Functional Requirement and Project Team
We need an unified data model to armonise and combine data sources to extract maximum value. Many data providers that sell sell-out data, their product are different as they evaluate different driver.

Every project start with the analysis of the data available and how to receive it automatically and to deal directly with local counterparts and data providers to understand how to proceed in an optimal way.

We integrate all the dataset received(ELT approach as every data could be useful for our evaluations).

### Data

Tries to find common KPI, common meaning in the data provided. 
The creation of a central database naturally leads to the need of data standardization in terms of:
- Dimensions of analysis
- KPI definitions
- Time Periods
- Language
- Currency
- Unit of measure
### Architecture and Process

Red Hub is external and Green Hub is internal. 
Since the data is external the customer wants to have an approval process before butting the result inside their database.

If the data are more present at runtime you have to use an approach where you interpolate between the customer needs and the value at disposal. The value is available only at the end. Always ask the way and the needs as they will help you develop the right model. You need to let the analysis be available the earlier possible.  
### Goals Achieved
You evaluate the result of your application and how it integrates with the users' needs. You also want to see what you can improve and what you can introduce in the application.
