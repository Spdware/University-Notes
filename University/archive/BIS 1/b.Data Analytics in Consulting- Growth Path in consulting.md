# Growth Path in Consulting
Path is:
- Consultant/Analyst: depends on the company, entry role in data analytic, they are the guys which do the technical stuffs. They are developer.
- Senior Consultant/Associate: the more you growth the more responsibilities you will have, face the responsibilities of the whole project. Deep dives in soft skills(Relationals, Interactions and people management). Have more knowledge on diverse domain, will have to learn also Functional skills 
- Manager: in charge of delivery for specific lines. You have to be the first to propose a new technology 
- Senior Manager: oversees multiple clients, focus on strategy. 
- Partner: part of the firm leaderships, responsible for business development, setting strategic direction and managing client relationships.
# Way of Working
### Time and Material Approach 
Client pay the consultant on the time and material consumed. 
Advantages:
- Flexibility: not focus on the strict requirements of the roadmap but only on the project. 
Disadvantages:
- challenging to acquire a client as you have to be fast, define a budget ....
### Turnkey
The requirements are defined at the beginning of the project, the client will pay at the ed the fixed price allocated at the start.
Advantages: clarity of cost and timelines, reduced client involvement in day-to-day project management activities.
Disadvantages: cannot make changes in the development , cost might be higher than predicted.
Contingency: mask putted in the estimation to face the small problem that could arise in the project. Helps to cover unpredictable fenomena.
### Service
Approach related to application managment. The client pays for a set of services provided from the consultant or consulting company. Agreeements may cover a specific set of skill, technical support, strategic consulting or other services.
Advantages: flexibility to acquire specific skill without managing an entire project.

Exercise:
1. Service(Correct Time and Material)
2. Service(Correct)
3. Turnkey
4. Time and Material
5. Turnkey
6. Turnkey(Correct Service but also Turnkey approach can be applied)
# Projects
Way of project development.
Waterfall vs Agile approach:
- Waterfall: you define in particular all the phase of the project,deadlines and deliverables. It is suited for a Turnkey approach. Do also unit, functionality, linking and User Acceptance test. Deployment phase is the last phase of the project other than the maintenance.
- Agile: requirement are not defined completely at the start of the project. Relies on backlog/sprints activities, lower the time between the start of the project and the deliverable as all the stage of the project will give out a deliverable(Completed for the sprints but lacking all the functionality of the project). Requirements can change over the whole project phase.
Exercise: 
Waterfall:
- Pros: define at the start all the component of the project and the timeline is defined, there is documentation
- Cons: Cannot react to the users feedback, Delayed feedback, client collaboration is limited.
Agile:
- Pros: react to the users feedback, present an iterative development, huge collaboration with the stake holder. 
- Cons: time constrain can not be respected, all the features are already defined at the start of the project, uncertainty, lack of documentation, storage creep
# Point of View

Use different points of view to transmit the whole project structure and what you are doing without seeming boring or leaving something out.
