Manufacturing companies produce tangible products, service companies produce intangible products:
- Services are made of “bits”, made of information
- Manufacturing products are made of atoms
- In service companies, IT is a production technology, a managerial technology and a distribution channel
- Services are produced while they are delivered
- In services, IT is simultaneously a production technology and a distribution channel

### Services value chain – definitions
4 phases:
- Service set-up: all the tasks that are needed to set up the production capacity of the company (e.g. for a bank, opening a new branch, or definiting contracts with external data entry services). It is the first step.
- Back-office tasks: production activities that are performed without the physical/virtual presence of the client, upon a client’s order
- Front-office tasks: production activities that are performed with the physical/virtual presence of the client, upon a client’s order
- Marketing and sales: tasks needed to advertise the company’s services, attract prospect customers, and sign service contracts with new customers
- Order management: it manages the information regarding orders from order check in to post-sale services.
- Knowledge management: it manages the new information on customers acquired during service production and distribution by transforming into knowledge that can be used to in future production and distribution activities to improve customer satisfaction
Order management and operations management coincide. Materials management is replaced by knowledge management. Service customization is a fundamental driver of customer satisfaction. Service customization requires knowledge about (individual) customers. Knowledge about customers is acquired during service production and distribution, but usually it is unstructured. Knowledge management processes gather this unstructured information and transform it into structured information and related customer service processes. Knowledge management is a continuous learning process. The environment changes (environmental uncertainty), therefore organizational processes must change through continuous learning.
