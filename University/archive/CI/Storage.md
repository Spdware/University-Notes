There are also hybrids as SSD are expensive so it was created a new system where a small SSD is combined with a large HDD upgrading the speed of 5 times over traditional HDD but SSD are used as a cache so you have to warm up this cache as it is treated as the cache of the operative system. It can also arrive to cost more than SSD in base at how much cache it uses.
