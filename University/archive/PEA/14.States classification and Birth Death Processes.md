Birth-death processes are special types of CTMC that studies the evolution of the number of the members of a population. Their state corresponds toe the count of the population in a given
time instant.

In each state i, the population can increase to state i+1 after a state depended exponentially distributed time, characterized by a rate $λ_i$ (measured for example in $s^{-1}$). Such transitions are called births.
The population in each non-zero state i can also decrease to the state i-1 after a state dependent exponentially distributed time of rate $μ_i$ (also measured in $s^{-1}$). Such transitions are called deaths.
Note that all rates can be different in each state. Excluding state 0, both birth and death can occur: the system will move to the next state according to which of the two events occurs first (race policy).

The number of states can be infinite: however if the system is stable, the probability of being in a state tends to zero as i tends to infinity, and only the first few states will have a non-negligible steady state probability.
The infinitesimal generator of the CTMC is a simple tri-diagonal matrix:
$$Q= \begin{vmatrix} -\lambda_0 & \lambda_0 \\
\mu_1 & -\lambda_1-\mu_1 & \lambda_1\\
&\mu_2&-\lambda_2-\mu_2&\lambda_2\\
&\ddots&\ddots&\ddots\\
&\mu_i&-\lambda_i-\mu_i&\lambda_i\\
&&\ddots&\ddots&\ddots\end{vmatrix}$$

The steady state probabilities of the CTMC can be explicitlycomputed solving the so called balance equations:
$$\pi Q= 0 \Rightarrow \pi_i(\lambda_i+\mu_i)=\pi_{i-1}\lambda_{i-1}+\pi_{i+1}\mu_{i+1}
$$
It can be proven that the probability $\pi_n$ of being in a state n is proportional to the following value:

That is, it exists a constant a such that:

# Required algebraic results
A few standard algebraic relations involving finite and infinite sums allows to analyze the special types of birth-death models we are going to consider next. They will allow to compute the previous formula in a simple closed form way for many interesting systems.
We will now summarize them:
