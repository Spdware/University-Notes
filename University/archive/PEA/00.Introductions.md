Performance evaluations is using techniques to evaluate a system and use the best material/technologies to maximise efficiency and minimise costs.
Exam based on some assignments given at every lesson and a small project(4 hours more or less). The assignment will challenge what you learn during the lessons, meanwhile the project is based on the analysing a system and choose what technique use that you used during the assignment. Two way to pass the exam: 
- Standard version: done as every other exam, oral discussion with the professor starting from the project and then there will be some questions also starting from the assignment 
- In-Course version: immediately study the material and do the assignment. The idea is you have the assignment and a due date(couple of weeks later, also later delivery is possible in reasonable time) and the project is given in the last lesson of the course. The evaluation is based on the answer of the assignment. The presence to the lessons is checked, but it is flessible for some time(can unlock the same week lessons in a single lesson) but not meant to be regular NOT possible to do it with course sovrapposition.
