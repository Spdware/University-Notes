We can generate random value using the corresponding functions of the programming languages.
These numbers are pseudo random as even if they are computed with a deterministic approach they are so diverse they can be considered unrelated. We can use seeds to to enhance this randomization. We can use the fact that the calculation is deterministic as we need that the sequence repeat to analyze it and maybe if there is a problem we need to fix.
Usually a computer program use to generate numbers in the range [0, 1)
We can generate random variables when we generate  choice between some values. We consider the different entries  and differentiate between them.
