Main purpose is to facilitate the performance modelling(drop and click).
# Introduction to Performance Models

Put together three domains:
- Real world: the reality, see how much physical resources to run your applications, there you have the real problem. Performance is becoming more and more important as we need to take less and less time. Need clearance on the specific
- Abstract space: space representing your experience and brain, what you know and the interactions with the real world
- Modelling domain

Performances are hurt by the bottlenecks.
# Variability of Interarrival and Service times
Every workload is affected by fluctuations/spike. The arriving process is really important as it define the way you need to handle the jobs.

We fix the service time and consider 5 different of time variable distribution. 
# Impact of Bottleneck Migration
Pay attention to equilibrium. 
First objective when you are analysing. It is very complex so it can be done isolating all the system components
