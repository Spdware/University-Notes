# Fork and Join
To achieve speed in computer science is splitting jobs in parts and execute them on different workers to achieve parallelization. "Problem": we are as fast as the slowest worker.
We can say the job has finished only when all the workers have finished working.
In the JMT tool there is the function Fork and Join that calculates these things for us.
Fork node will split jobs between all the station that are attached to it. 
SOme applications allow KooN systems(K out of N task have reached the join node and the job is considered finished and the other K-N tasks are discarded)
Class switches: sometimes you need to switch between classes.
