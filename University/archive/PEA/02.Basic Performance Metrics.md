Arrival and Completion time functions are step functions so we can extract the time instant when there is a jump in the functions. These time instant can be easily obtained.

From them we can derive the interarrivals times, the time between the arrivals of two consecutive jobs, $a_i=A^{-1}(i+1)-A^{-1}(i)$. 
From this we can derive the A(T) function. Lets call I(X) the indicator function which returns 1 if proposition X is true 0 otherwise and assume that $a_0$ accounts for the arrival time of the first job:
$$A(T)=\sum_{K=!}I(\sum_{i=0}^{K-1}a_i\le T), A^{-1}(i)=\sum_{k=0}^{i-1}a_k$$
For the response time we have an harder time as jobs can be stopped and resumed, but if we have an extra hypothesis as jobs are served one at a time and they are served in order of arrive we will have the departures in order and we can estimate $r_i=C^{-1}(i)-A^{-1}(i)$ 
Under the same assumptions we can compute the completion time of each job: 
$$C(T)=\sum_KI(A^{-1}(K)+r_k\le T)$$
If we have the arrival instant and the service time we can compute the instant completion time as:
$$C^{-1}(i)=max(A^{-1}(i),C^{-1}(i-1))+s_i$$
From that we can obtain the service time $s_i$ isolating it in the equation.
### Basic Relations
If we set the time T as the time between the first arrival and the moment before another arrival in an empty system(one cycle of the system) we can have:
$$A(T)=C(T)\text{, }\sum_{i=1}^{A(T)}a_i=T\text{, }\sum_{i=1}^{C(T)}s_i=B(T)$$
We can consider the average inter-arrival time:
$$\bar A=\lim_{T\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\sum_{i=1}{A(T)}a_i}{A(T)}, \lambda=\frac{1}{\bar A}$$
If a system is stable there will always be a point in time where A(T)=C(T). Thus if the system is stable and there are no losses throughput and arrival rates are always equal: $\lambda=X$
If the system is unstable, A(T) and C(T) will diverge, and after a given point in time, the system will never return empty again: $\lambda>X$.
### Stability Conditions
By construction, since B(T) is less or equal to T, then the utilization should be less than one:
$$B(T)\le T\Rightarrow U=\frac{B(T)}{T}\le 1$$
Although there exists special cases in which the system is stable with U exactly equal to one (U = 1), they are extremely rare. In most of the cases, B(T) = T means that the system never returns
to an empty state, thus it is unstable. For this reason, we usually prefer to check that:
$$B(T)<T\Rightarrow U<1$$
Stability condition allows to find limiting relations between the arrival rate and the average service:
$$XS=\lambda S=\frac{S}{\bar A}\le 1
$$
$$\lambda\le\frac{1}{S}\text{, }S\le\frac{1}{\lambda}\text{, }S\le\bar A$$
$$X\le\frac{1}{S}\text{, }S\le\frac{1}{X}\text{, }\frac{1}{X}=\bar A$$
### Response Time Distribution
Another thing we can compute is that the response time is less than a threshold:
$$p(R<\tau)=\frac{\sum_{i=!}^{C}I(r_i<\tau)}{C}$$
This relation can be extended to any predicate $\Psi(R)$ and it can be used to compute the probability that the response time respects a given property: 
$$p(\Psi(R))=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{C}I(\Psi(r_i))}{C}$$
### Queue Length Distribution
With a slightly more complex procedure, we can determine the probability of having n jobs in the system from A(t) and C(t). First we observe that between arrivals or services, the population in the system remains constant. Letâ€™s call $t_i$ the time at which either an arrival, or a departure occur.

Note that, although very close, we suppose that the departure of the first job $t_3$ is just slightly before the arrival of the third job $t_4$ . At a given point in time t between two instants ti and $t_{i+1}$, the number of jobs in the system n(t) is constant and equal to: $n(t)=A(T) - C(T)$, remember the assumption the system start empty. We can then compute $Y_m$ as the fraction of time the system has m jobs:
$$Y_m=\int_0^T I(n(t)=m)dt$$

This integral can also be computed as a summation of the differences between consecutive time instants where we have the given number of jobs in the system

We can then approximate the probability of having n jobs in the system in the following way:
$$p(N = m)=\frac{Y_m}{T}$$
Note that also in this case, the technique can be extended to compute the probability that a given predicate Y(N) on the number of jobs is true. If we call $\Psi(N)$ the time in which the system fullfill such property, we have:
$$p(\Psi(N))=\frac{Y_{\Psi(N)}}{T}$$
With these relations, we can estimate B, W and N in other ways:
$$B=\sum_{m=1}Y_m=T-T_0\text{, }W=\sum_{m=1}m\cdotp Y_m\text{, }N=\sum_{m=1}m\cdotp p(N=m)$$
