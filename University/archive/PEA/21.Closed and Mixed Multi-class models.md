Analytical solutions exists also for closed and mixed multi-class models. Their implementation is however quite complex, and we will resort to tools such as the JMVA module of JMT to use
ready-made solutions of the considered systems. We will briefly describe the relevant techniques to showcase how such implementations work.
If we have a single closed process is a single MVA but with multiple closed processes we need a multi MVA.
