We can do very few things when there are non exponential distributions. One thing we can do is G/G/c queues. Usually in  reality we have Poisson distribution. 

### M/G/1
- M: arrival to the system follow a poisson process and the service have a general distribution as long as the service time are independent

Service time(first moment of the system):
$$D = E[X_G] = \int_0^\infty tf_G(t)dt=\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}[\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N X_G]$$
Second moment:
$$m_2=E[X_G^2] = \int_0^\infty t^2f_G(t)dt=\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}[\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N X_G^2]$$
Traffic intensity $\rho$(stable if $\rho$ < 1):
$$\rho = \lambda D = \lambda E[X_G]$$

#### FCFS
Let us focus on First-Come-First-Served service center. The average response time of a station is the sum of three terms: Service Time, Queueing Time and Remaining Time of the job in service at the arrival. Queuing time and remaining service time of the job in service at the arrival determine the time a job will have to wait before being served.

The waiting time in the queue W can be computed from A’, the number of jobs found waiting (not in service) by one job at its arrival:
$$W=A'E[X_G] = A' D$$
With a few derivations, A’ can be expressed as function of W, leading to an equation from which W can be determined.
Since Poisson arrivals can basically occur at any time with the same probability, the number of jobs found at the arrival in a station is identical to the average number of jobs in that queue.
$$A = N$$

Applying Little’s Law, this can be expressed as function of the Response Time:
$$𝐴 = 𝑁 = 𝑋  𝑅 = 𝜆  𝑅= 𝜆  (𝐷 + 𝑊 + 𝑤)$$

$$N_q = A'= N - U = A-U\Rightarrow A = A'+U$$
$$𝐴^′ = 𝐴 − 𝑈$$
$$𝐴^′= 𝜆  𝐷 + 𝑊 + 𝑤 − \lambda D$$
$$𝐴^′= 𝜆  𝑊 + 𝑤$$
We can use this result to express the waiting time due to other jobs in the queue as function of the average remaining time of the costumer currently in service.
The average response time R can than be computed as function of the remaining service time w:
$$R = D + W + w = D + \frac{w}{1-\rho}$$
Let us call k(t) the waiting time function. The average waiting time w can be computed as the time average of function k(t).
$$w = lim_{T\rightarrow \infty}[\frac{1}{T}\int_0^T k(t)dy]=\lim_{T\rightarrow \infty}\frac{C(T)}{T}\lim_{T\rightarrow \infty}\frac{1}{C(T)}\sum_{i=1}^{C(T)}\frac{x_i^2}{2}$$
This result permit the computation of the response time as:
$$R = D + \frac{\lambda m_2}{2(1-\rho)}$$
Using Little's law we can compute the average number of jobs in the system:
$$N = \rho + \frac{\lambda^2m_2}{2(1-\rho)}$$
Remembering the relations between the first two moments, the variance and the coefficient of variation, we can write:
