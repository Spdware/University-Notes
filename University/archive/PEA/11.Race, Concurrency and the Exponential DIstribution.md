We now consider a mobile application. We need to consider different cellular applications.

We would like to compute:
- State probabilities
- Throughput: trip that this application can do
In this case, the choice between the transition from state 1 to either state 2, 3 or 4, is guided by a discrete random variable.
$P_{1\rightarrow 2}$ = 0.3
$P_{1\rightarrow3}$ = 0.7 . 0.6 = 0.42
$P_{1\rightarrow4}$ = 0.7 . 0.4 = 0.28
The system is similar to the one we have done before:
```Pseudocode
Algorithm that handles the state machine
if s = 1 then
	ns = 2u = rand()
	if u < 0.3
		ns = 2;
	else if u < 0.72
		ns = 3;
	else
		ns = 4;
	end
dt = GenErlang(5,4);
end
	if s = 2 then
		ns = 1;
		dt = GenErlang(10,2);
	end
if s = 3 then
```
