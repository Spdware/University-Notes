We now consider a mobile application. We need to consider different cellular applications.

We would like to compute:
- State probabilities
- Throughput: trip that this application can do
In this case, the choice between the transition from state 1 to either state 2, 3 or 4, is guided by a discrete random variable.
$P_{1\rightarrow 2}$ = 0.3
$P_{1\rightarrow3}$ = 0.7 . 0.6 = 0.42
$P_{1\rightarrow4}$ = 0.7 . 0.4 = 0.28
The system is similar to the one we have done before:
```Pseudocode
Algorithm that handles the state machine
if s = 1 then
	ns = 2u = rand()
	if u < 0.3
		ns = 2;
	else if u < 0.72
		ns = 3;
	else
		ns = 4;
	end
dt = GenErlang(5,4);
end
	if s = 2 then
		ns = 1;
		dt = GenErlang(10,2);
	end
if s = 3 then
```
### Race
Whenever we have different distribution that start at the same time.

The idea is that when the race start we will determine the random completion time of the racers and determine each time the winning racer.
We would like to compute
- Victory probability for each car
- Average duration of a match.
```
if s = 1 then
	tA = GenXA();
	…
	tD = GenXD();
	if (tA == min(tA, tB, tC, tD)) then
		ns = 2; dt = tA;
	end
	if (tB == min(tA, tB, tC, tD)) then
		ns = 3; dt = tB;
	…
end
if s = 2 then
	ns = 1;
	dt = GenErlang();
end
if s = 3 then
	ns = 1;
	…
	…
	if s = 1 then
		if (tA == min(tA, tB, tC, tD)) then
			ns = 2; dt = tA;
			WinA ++;
		end
		…
		Races ++;
		RT(CurrRace,1) = dt;
		CurrRace ++;
	end
…
PwinA = WinA / Races;
PwinB = WinB / Races;
PwinC = WinC / Races;
PwinD = WinD / Races;
AvgRT = mean(RT);
```
In this case, the choice of the next state is determined by the so called Race policy:
- the next state is chosen according to the path that has extracted the minimum time
This is possible only in very few cases, in which all the transitions starts at the same time (such in this example), or when we have some special firing time distribution for the event.
#### L'eredità exxample
We want to simulate a two-contestant game: two people have 60 s. each, in which they have to answer a set of questions. Each time a player gives the correct answer, the turn passes to the other and hers timer stops. The player for which the timer expires first loses the game. Each player finds the correct answer in an exponentially distributed amount of time, with an average of 10 s. Player one starts, and when a contestant loses, the game restarts after a deterministic time of 1 min.

### Concurrency
There are activities that run in parallel. When we have concurrency we need to decide which event happens first.
Concurrency can occur in many forms, and in general it cannot be handled with simple solutions like the ones previously seen. Consider for example the state machine for the operative system process that we saw last time, applied to a batch process (a closed model): whenever a job ends, it restarts after a “think time”.

In case of a single batch process, jobs can be dispatched immediately, and the system would be in the “ready” state for a negligible amount of time. Such state could be removed. Selection between “I/O wait” and “exit” in the running state can be performed using choice: a distribution of running before an event, and couple of probabilities for either ending or doing I/O.

In case of more jobs, different types of concurrency occur in almost all the states, and choice cannot be used to solve the problem in all states.
Concurrency in general can be handled using Discrete Event Simulation. A complete description on how to perform Discrete Event Simulation, is however outside the scope of this course.

### Exponential distribution and concurrency
When ALL random timing follows an exponential distribution, analyzing systems become simpler thanks to its memory less property:
- Race policy becomes identical to concurrency
- Choice can be implemented with race policy, by embedding selection probability into the rates.
Race policy becomes identical to concurrency: for example, if in the “l’Eredità” game the timer would be exponentially distributed with an average of one minute, it could be analyzed in the following way:

Choice can be implemented with race policy, using the product of the original exponential rate parameter with the selection probability. For example, a 4G only version of the remote app model become:
